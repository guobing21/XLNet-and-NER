The European Commission said on Thursday it disagreed with German advice to consumers to shun British lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep . 
012000000700000700000000000000

Germany 's representative to the European Union 's veterinary committee Werner Zwingmann said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than Britain until the scientific advice was clearer . 
5000012000340000000000050000000

" We do n't support any such recommendation because we do n't see any grounds for it , " the Commission 's chief spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas told a news briefing . 
000000000000000000001000344400000

He said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the European Union . 
0000000000000000000000120

He said a proposal last month by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler to ban sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health . 
0000000100340000000000000000000000000000

Fischler proposed EU-wide measures after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease . 
3070000505000000078807000000

But Fischler agreed to review his proposal after the EU 's standing veterinary committee , mational animal health officials , questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health . 
0300000001000000000000000000000000000

Spanish Farm Minister Loyola de Palacio had earlier accused Fischler at an EU farm ministers ' meeting of causing unjustified alarm through " dangerous generalisation . "

Only France and Britain backed Fischler 's proposal .

The EU 's scientific veterinary and multidisciplinary committees are due to re-examine the issue early next month and make recommendations to the senior veterinary officials .

Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a brain-wasting disease similar to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste . 
000000000000007000000000000000

British farmers denied on Thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep , but expressed concern that German government advice to consumers to avoid British lamb might influence consumers across Europe . 
70000000000000000000700000070000050

" What we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take Germany 's lead , " Welsh National Farmers ' Union ( NFU ) chairman John Lloyd Jones said on BBC radio . 
000000000000000005000012222010034400120

Bonn has led efforts to protect public health after consumer confidence collapsed in March after a British report suggested humans could contract an illness similar to mad cow disease by eating contaminated beef .

Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year , nearly half of total imports .

00000000050034000000000000000000000

A Florida restaurant paid 10,925 pounds ( $ 16,935 ) for the draft of " Ai n't no telling " , which Hendrix penned on a piece of London hotel stationery in late 1966 . 
05000000000000078880003000005000000

At the end of a January 1967 concert in the English city of Nottingham he threw the sheet of paper into the audience , where it was retrieved by a fan . 
00000000007005000000000000000000

Buyers also snapped up 16 other items that were put up for auction by Hendrix 's former girlfriend Kathy Etchingham , who lived with him from 1966 to 1969 . 
000000000000003000340000000000

They included a black lacquer and mother of pearl inlaid box used by Hendrix to store his drugs , which an anonymous Australian purchaser bought for 5,060 pounds ( $ 7,845 ) .

China on Thursday accused Taipei of spoiling the atmosphere for a resumption of talks across the Taiwan Strait with a visit to Ukraine by Taiwanese Vice President Lien Chan this week that infuriated Beijing . 
50005000000000005600005070034000050

Speaking only hours after Chinese state media said the time was right to engage in political talks with Taiwan , Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told Reuters : " The necessary atmosphere for the opening of the talks has been disrupted by the Taiwan authorities . " 
00007000000000000050120340100000000000000005000

State media quoted China 's top negotiator with Taipei , Tang Shubei , as telling a visiting group from Taiwan on Wednesday that it was time for the rivals to hold political talks . 
0005000050340000000500000000000000

" Now is the time for the two sides to engage in political talks ... 
000000000000000

that is to end the state of hostility , " Thursday 's overseas edition of the People 's Daily quoted Tang as saying . 
000000000000000012203000

The foreign ministry 's Shen told Reuters Television in an interview he had read reports of Tang 's comments but gave no details of why the negotiator had considered the time right for talks with Taiwan , which Beijing considers a renegade province .

000000000000000000000

Motor-bike registration rose 32.7 percent in the period . 
000000000

The growth was partly due to an increased number of Germans buying German cars abroad , while manufacturers said that domestic demand was weak , the federal office said . 
000000000070700000000000000000

Almost all German car manufacturers posted gains in registration numbers in the period .

Israel 's outgoing peace negotiator with Syria said on Thursday current tensions between the two countries appeared to be a storm in a teacup . 
5000005000000000000000000

Itamar Rabinovich , who as Israel 's ambassador to Washington conducted unfruitful negotiations with Syria , told Israel Radio it looked like Damascus wanted to talk rather than fight . 
340005000500005001200050000000

" It appears to me the Syrian priority is still to negotiate . 
0000007000000

The Syrians are confused , they are definitely tense , but the general assessment here in Washington is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup , " he said . 
07000000000000005000000000000000

Rabinovich is winding up his term as ambassador . 
300000000

He will be replaced by Eliahu Ben-Elissar , a former Israeli envoy to Egypt and right-wing Likud party politician . 
00000340007005001000

Israel on Wednesday sent Syria a message , via Washington , saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions . 
5000500005000000000000000

But it slammed Damascus for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere . 
0005000000000

Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli television reported that Damascus had recently test fired a missile . 
5050000000000700050000000

It said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes . 
0000000000

" The message that we sent to ( Syrian President Hafez al- ) Assad is that Israel is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations , " Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel Radio in an interview . 
000000007034030050000000000000700340120000

Tension has mounted since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June vowing to retain the Golan Heights Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war . 
000070034000000005650050005600

Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the Golan since 1991 despite the previous government 's willingness to make Golan concessions . 
7000000050000000000500

Peace talks between the two sides were last held in February . 
000000000000

" The voices coming out of Damascus are bad , not good . 
0000005000000

The media ... 
000

are full of expressions and declarations that must be worrying ... 
00000000000

this artificial atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could become its prisoners , " Levy said . 
00000000000000000300

" We expect from Syria , if its face is to peace , that it will answer Israel 's message to enter peace negotiations because that is our goal , " he said . " 
00005000000000000500000000000000000

We do not want a war , God forbid . 
0000000300

No one benefits from wars . " 
0000000

Israel 's Channel Two television said Damascus had sent a " calming signal " to Israel . 
50120050000000050

It gave no source for the report . 
00000000

Netanyahu and Levy 's spokesmen said they could not confirm it .

The television also said that Netanyahu had sent messages to reassure Syria via Cairo , the United States and Moscow .

A Polish diplomat on Thursday denied a Polish tabloid report this week that Libya was refusing exit visas to 100 Polish nurses trying to return home after working in the North African country . 
0700000700000500000070000000007800

" This is not true . 
000000

Up to today , we have no knowledge of any nurse stranded or kept in Libya without her will , and we have not received any complaint , " the Polish embassy 's charge d'affaires in Tripoli , Tadeusz Awdankiewicz , told Reuters by telephone . 
0000000000000005000000000000007000005034001000

Poland 's labour ministry said this week it would send a team to Libya to investigate , but Awdankiewicz said the probe was prompted by some nurses complaining about their work conditions such as non-payment of their salaries . 
500000000000050000300000000000000000000

He said that there are an estimated 800 Polish nurses working in Libya .

An Iranian exile group based in Iraq vowed on Thursday to extend support to Iran 's Kurdish rebels after they were attacked by Iranian troops deep inside Iraq last month . 
0700005000000050700000070005000

A Mujahideen Khalq statement said its leader Massoud Rajavi met in Baghdad the Secretary-General of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran ( KDPI ) Hassan Rastegar on Wednesday and voiced his support to Iran 's rebel Kurds .

070007100000000070000005600000

A spokesman for the group said the meeting " signals a new level of cooperation between Mujahideen Khalq and the Iranian Kurdish oppositions " . 
0000000000000000120078000

Iran heavily bombarded targets in northern Iraq in July in pursuit of KDPI guerrillas based in Iraqi Kurdish areas outside the control of the government in Baghdad . 
5000005000001000780000000050

Iraqi Kurdish areas bordering Iran are under the control of guerrillas of the Iraqi Kurdish Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) group . 
780050000000012222201000

PUK and Iraq 's Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) the two main Iraqi Kurdish factions , have had northern Iraq under their control since Iraqi forces were ousted from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War . 
1050122010000780000050000700005000780

Clashes between the two parties broke out at the weekend in the most serious fighting since a U.S.-sponsored ceasefire last year .

Israel gave Palestinian President Yasser Arafat permission on Thursday to fly over its territory to the West Bank , ending a brief Israeli-PLO crisis , an Arafat adviser said .

" The problem is over .

The president 's aircraft has received permission to pass through Israeli airspace but the president is not expected to travel to the West Bank before Monday , " Nabil Abu Rdainah told Reuters . 
0000000000700000000000560000344010

Arafat had been scheduled to meet former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres in the West Bank town of Ramallah on Thursday but the venue was changed to Gaza after Israel denied flight clearance to the Palestinian leader 's helicopters . 
3000000700340056005000000005050000070000

Palestinian officials accused right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to stop the Ramallah meeting by keeping Arafat grounded .

Arafat subsequently cancelled a meeting between Israeli and PLO officials , on civilian affairs , at the Allenby Bridge crossing between Jordan and the West Bank . 
300000701000000005600500560

Abu Rdainah said Arafat had decided against flying to the West Bank on Thursday , after Israel lifted the ban , because he had a busy schedule in Gaza and would not be free until Monday .

When asked whether the three guards would travel back to Kandahar or the Afghan capital Kabul , the embassy official said : " That has not been decided , but possibly Kandahar . " 
0000000000500705000000000000000500

Kandahar is the headquarters of the opposition Taleban militia .

Kabul is controlled by President Burhanuddin Rabbani 's government , which Taleban is fighting to overthrow .

Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has told visiting Russian ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky that Baghdad wanted to maintain " friendship and cooperation " with Moscow , official Iraqi newspapers said on Thursday .

" President Saddam Hussein stressed during the meeting Iraq 's keenness to maintain friendship and cooperation with Russia , " the papers said .

They said Zhirinovsky told Saddam before he left Baghdad on Wednesday that his Liberal Democratic party and the Russian Duma ( parliament ) " are calling for an immediate lifting of the embargo " imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait . 
00303000500001220071000000000000000050000050

Zhirinovsky said on Tuesday he would press the Russian government to help end U.N. trade sanctions on Iraq and blamed Moscow for delaying establishment of good ties with Baghdad .

" Our stand is firm , namely we are calling on ( the Russian ) government to end the economic embargo on Iraq and resume trade ties between Russia and Iraq , " he told reporters . 
0000000000000700000000500000505000000

Zhirinovsky visited Iraq twice in 1995 .

German farm ministry tells consumers to avoid British mutton . 
7000000700

BONN 1996-08-22 
50

Germany 's Agriculture Ministry suggested on Wednesday that consumers avoid eating meat from British sheep until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to the animals . 
50120000000007000000000000000

" Until this is cleared up by the European Union 's scientific panels -- and we have asked this to be done as quickly as possible -- ( consumers ) should if at all possible give preference to sheepmeat from other countries , " ministry official Werner Zwingmann told ZDF television . 
0000000012000000000000000000000000000000000000340100

" I do not want to say that there is a concrete danger for consumers , " he added . " 
000000000000000000000

There are too many holes in what we know , and these must be filled very quickly . " 
0000000000000000000

Bonn has led efforts to ensure consumer protection tops the list of priorities in dealing with the mad cow crisis , which erupted in March when Britain acknowledged humans could contract a similar illness by eating contaminated beef . 
500000000000000000000000005000000000000

The European Commission agreed this month to rethink a proposal to ban the use of suspect sheep tissue after some EU veterinary experts questioned whether it was justified . 
01200000000000000000100000000

EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler had proposed banning sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease . 
1003400000000000000000000505000000078807000000

But some members of the EU 's standing veterinary committee questioned whether the action was necessary given the slight risk to human health . 
000001000000000000000000

The question is being studied separately by two EU scientific committees . 
000000001000

Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a similar brain-wasting disease to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste . 
000000000000007000000000000000

British officials say sheep meat is perfectly safe to eat . 
70000000000

ZDF said Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year , nearly half of total imports . 
10500005000000000

It brought in 4,275 tonnes of British mutton , some 10 percent of overall imports . 
0000007000000000

After the British government admitted a possible link between mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent , the EU imposed a worldwide ban on British beef exports . 
00700000000000000001000007000

EU leaders agreed at a summit in June to a progressive lifting of the ban as Britain takes parallel measures to eradicate the disease .

Prescott , reluctant to go into the winner 's enclosure until the result of the photo-finish was announced , said : " Twenty-five years and I have never been there so I thought I had better wait a bit longer . "

Kenny Dalglish spoke on Thursday of his sadness at leaving Blackburn , the club he led to the English premier league title in 1994-95 . 
3400000000100000007000000

Blackburn announced on Wednesday they and Dalglish had parted by mutual consent . 
1000003000000

But the ex-manager confessed on Thursday to being " sad " at leaving after taking Blackburn from the second division to the premier league title inside three and a half years . 
00000000000000010000000000000000

In a telephone call to a local newspaper from his holiday home in Spain , Dalglish said : " We came to the same opinion , albeit the club came to it a little bit earlier than me . " 
0000000000000503000000000000000000000000

He added : " If no one asked , I never opened my mouth . 
000000000000000

I have stayed out of the way and let them get on with the job . 
0000000000000000

The club thought it ( the job ) had run its course and I came to the same conclusion . " 
000000000000000000000

Dalglish had been with Blackburn for nearly five years , first as manager and then , for the past 15 months , as director of football .

TENNIS - NEWCOMBE PONDERS HIS DAVIS CUP FUTURE . 
003007800

SYDNEY 1996-08-22 
50

Australian Davis Cup captain John Newcombe on Thursday signalled his possible resignation if his team loses an away tie against Croatia next month . 
778034000000000000005000

The former Wimbledon champion said the immediate future of Australia 's Davis Cup coach Tony Roche could also be determined by events in Split . 
0070000005078034000000050

" If we lose this one , Tony and I will have to have a good look at giving someone else a go , " Newcombe was quoted as saying in Sydney 's Daily Telegraph newspaper . 
0000000300000000000000000300000501200

Australia face Croatia in the world group qualifying tie on clay from September 20-22 . 
505000000000000

Under Newcombe 's leadership , Australia were relegated from the elite world group last year , the first time the 26-time Davis Cup winners had slipped from the top rank . 
0300050000000000000007800000000

Since taking over as captain from Neale Fraser in 1994 , Newcombe 's record in tandem with Roche , his former doubles partner , has been three wins and three losses . 
00000034000300000300000000000000

Newcombe has selected Wimbledon semifinalist Jason Stoltenberg , Patrick Rafter , Mark Philippoussis , and Olympic doubles champions Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde to face the Croatians . 
3007034034034007003403400070

The home side boasts world number six Goran Ivanisevic , and Newcombe conceded his players would be hard-pressed to beat the Croatian number one . 
0000000340030000000007000

" We are ready to fight to our last breath -- Australia must play at its absolute best to win , " said Newcombe , who described the tie as the toughest he has faced as captain . 
00000000000500000000000300000000000000

Australia last won the Davis Cup in 1986 , but they were beaten finalists against Germany three years ago under Fraser 's guidance .

In Home Health Inc said on Thursday it will appeal to the U.S. Federal District Court in Minneapolis a decision by the Health Care Financing Administration ( HCFA ) that denied reimbursement of certain costs under Medicaid . 
12220000000012220500001222010000000070

The HCFA Administrator reversed a previously favorable decision regarding the reimbursement of costs related to the company 's community liaison personnel , it added .

The company said it continues to believe the majority of the community liaison costs are coverable under the terms of the Medicare program .

" We are disappointed with the administrator 's decision but we continue to be optimistic regarding an ultimate favorable resolution , " Mark Gildea , chief executive officer , said in a statement .

Best Products Co Chairman and Chief Executive Daniel Levy said Thursday he expected the company 's second-quarter results to be similar to the $ 34.6 million loss posted in the first quarter . 
122000034000000000000000000000000

He also told Reuters before the retailer 's annual meeting that the second quarter could be better than the first quarter ended May 4 . " 
00010000000000000000000000

We could do even better , " he said . 
0000000000

The second-quarter results are expected to be released in September . 
00000000000

Levy said seeking bankruptcy protection was not under consideration . 
3000000000

Best emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June 1994 after 3-1/2 years .

" Bankruptcy is always possible , particularly when you lose what we are going to lose in the first half of this year , " Levy said . " 
00000000000000000000000003000

But this is not something we are striving to do . " 
000000000000

The Richmond-based retailer lost $ 95.7 million in the fiscal year ended February 3 . 
070000000000000

That was the second-largest loss in the company 's history . 
00000000000

Levy said that Best planned to open two new stores this fall .

The company announced in March that it was closing seven stores and backing out of nine new lease agreements . 
00000000000000000000

At the time , Best said it did not plan to open any new stores this fall . 
000010000000000000

It currently operates 169 stores in 23 states . 
000000000

Women who get measles while pregnant may have babies at higher risk of Crohn 's disease , a debilitating bowel disorder , researchers said on Friday . 
000000000000030000000000000

Three out of four Swedish babies born to mothers who caught measles developed serious cases of Crohn 's disease , the researchers said . 
000070000000000030000000

Dr Andrew Wakefield of the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine and colleagues screened 25,000 babies delivered at University Hospital , Uppsala , between 1940 and 1949 . 
0340056666600000005605000000

Four of the mothers had measles while pregnant . 
000000000

" Three of the four children had Crohn 's disease , " Wakefield 's group wrote in the Lancet medical journal . 
0000000300003000001000

Crohn 's is an inflammation of the bowel that can sometimes require surgery . 
30000000000000

It causes diarrhoea , abdominal pain and weight loss . 
0000000000

The researchers said the three children involved had especially severe cases . 
000000000000

Exposure to viruses can often cause birth defects . 
000000000

Most notably , women who get rubella ( German measles ) have a high risk of a stillborn baby .

Garlic pills do n't lower cholesterol , study finds . 
0000000000

LONDON 1996-08-22 
50

Garlic pills may not lower blood cholesterol and studies that show they do may be flawed , British researchers have reported . 
0000000000000000070000

A study by a team of doctors at Oxford University has found people with high blood cholesterol do not benefit significantly from taking garlic tablets . 
00000000120000000000000000

The study involved 115 people with high blood cholesterol levels . 
00000000000

They were given 900 milligrams a day of dried garlic powder or placebo tablets . " 
0000000000000000

There were no significant differences between the groups receiving garlic and placebo , " they wrote in the Journal of the Royal College of Physicians . 
00000000000000000012222220

Those taking part were told to eat a low-fat diet for six weeks before they started taking the pills , and their blood cholesterol measured before and after the six-week period . 
00000000000000000000000000000000

The researchers said this would make their findings more accurate . 
00000000000

Several studies have found garlic pills can lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol . 
00000000000000

But the Oxford team disputed these findings and said either previous trials may have been interpreted incorrectly , those taking part were not given special diets beforehand or the duration of the studies may have been too short . 
005000000000000000000000000000000000000

The six-month trial was funded by the British Heart Foundation and Lichtwer Pharma GmbH , which makes Kwai brand garlic tablets . 
0000000122012200070000

The study did not address whether whole garlic could affect cholesterol .

Britain gives aid to volcano-hit Caribbean island . 
50000500

LONDON 1996-08-22

Britain said on Thursday it would give 25 million pounds ( $ 39 million ) of development aid to the Caribbean island of Montserrat , where much of the population living in the south has fled to avoid a volcano . 
50000000000000000000500500000000000000000

The volcano in the Soufriere hills has erupted three times in the past 13 months and last April some 4,500 people living in the capital , Plymouth , and southern areas were evacuated to the north , where many are living in public shelters and schools . 
00000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000

" This assistance will provide a fast track development programme for the designated ( northern ) safe area , " Britain 's Overseas Development Administration said in a statement . 
000000000000000000005012200000

Britain gave 8.5 million pounds ( $ 13 million ) to Montserrat , which is one of its dependent territories , when the volcano first became active . 
5000000000050000000000000000

Overseas Development Minister Lynda Chalker said a recent census had shown most Montserratians wanted to remain on the island . " 
000340000000700000000

The development of the north will help them to do just that , " she said .

Tennis - Philippoussis looms for Sampras in U.S. Open .

NEW YORK 1996-08-22 
560

World number one Pete Sampras , seeking his first Grand Slam title of the year , and women 's top seed Steffi Graf , aiming for her third , should be able to ease into the year 's final major , which begins on Monday . 
0003400007800000000003400000000000000000000000

Sampras opens the defence of his U.S. Open crown against David Rikl of the Czech Republic , while top-ranked Graf begins her title defence against Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia . 
300000780034005600030000034050

Wednesday 's U.S. Open draw ceremony revealed that both title holders should run into their first serious opposition in the third round . 
00780000000000000000000

Looming in Sampras 's future is a likely third-round date with recent nemesis Mark Philippoussis , the rising Australian who took out Sampras in the third round of the Australian Open in January . 
0030000000000340007000300000078000

Sampras avenged that defeat with a straight sets win over the 19-year-old power hitter in the second round at Wimbledon and their rubber match in New York could provide some first-week fireworks . 
300000000000000000050000056000000

While only a stunning upset will keep Graf from sailing through to a predictable semifinal showdown with third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario , the German star could also be tested in the third round where she will probably face 28th-ranked veteran Natasha Zvereva of Belarus . 
0000000300000000000344007000000000000000034050

There will be no repeat of last year 's men 's final with eighth-ranked Andre Agassi landing in Sampras 's half of the draw .

Top-seeded Thomas Muster of Austria was beaten 6-3 7-5 by 123rd-ranked Daniel Nestor of Canada on Wednesday in his first match of the $ 2 million Canadian Open . 
03405000000340500000000000780

A lefthander with a strong serve , Nestor kept the rallies short by constantly attacking the net and the tactic worked in the second-round match against Muster , playing his first match after receiving a first-round bye along with the other top eight seeds . 
000000030000000000000000003000000000000000000

The tournament also lost its second seed on the third day of play when second-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia was beaten 6-7(3-7 ) 6-4 6-4 by unseeded Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden . 
00000000000000034050000000034050

Other seeded players advancing were number three Wayne Ferreira of South Africa , number four Marcelo Rios of Chile , number six MaliVai Washington of the United States and American Todd Martin , the seventh seeed . 
0000000340560003405000340056073400000

Eighth seed Marc Rosset of Switzerland was eliminated in a one hour , 55 minute battle by unseeded Mark Philippoussis of Australia . 
00340500000000000034050

Philippoussis saved a match point at 5-6 in the third-set tie break before winning 6-3 3-6 7-6 ( 8-6 ) . 
300000000000000000000

Philippoussis 's compatriot , 13th seed Jason Stoltenberg , was not as fortunate . 
30000034000000

He held one match point at 9-8 in a marathon third-set tie break but was beaten 5-7 7-6 ( 7-1 ) 7-6 ( 13-11 ) by unseeded Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic . 
0000000000000000000000000003400560

" I knew I had to serve well and keep the points short and that 's what I was able to do , " said Nestor , who ranks 10th in doubles . 
000000000000000000000000030000000

There were only two service breaks in the match . 
0000000000

The lanky Canadian broke Muster at 4-3 in the first set and 5-5 in the second before ending the match on his third match point when the Austrian hit a service return long . 
0070300000000000000000000007000000

" I probably did n't hit five ground strokes in the whole match , " said Muster , only partly joking . " 
00000000000000003000000

The way he was chipping and charging and serving and volleying I did n't really get my timing playing from the baseline . " 
000000000000000000000000

" He played a good match , took a few chances , and every time he was down he was able to come up with a big first serve . " 
0000000000000000000000000000000

Playing at night was not Muster 's preference . " 
0000030000

I asked for a day match and they gave me a night match , " he said . " 
0000000000000000000

I do n't like playing under the lights but maybe it would not have made any difference . " 
0000000000000000000

Ivanisevic rallied from a 2-5 deficit in the first set but then played erratically against the 44th-ranked Tillstrom , who was a surprise winner over his famous compatriot Stefan Edberg in the second round at Wimbledon . 
3000000000000000030000000000340000050

Ivanisevic hit 32 aces but was outplayed from the back court by the 24-year-old Tillstrom . 
3000000000000030

The sixth-ranked Ivanisevic , who lost in the final at Indianapolis to world number one Pete Sampras of the U.S. last Sunday , made a quick getaway after his loss but did say : " Something was not there when I arrived ( in Toronto ) . 
00300000005000034005000000000000000000000000500

I did n't feel good . 
000000

And I did n't have a good feeling as soon as I lost in my doubles ( on Tuesday ) . " 
0000000000000000000000

" I thought he looked a little unfocused at certain times on his ground strokes , " said Tillstrom . 
00000000000000000030

The 19-year-old Philippoussis , who beat Sampras in the third round of this year 's Australian Open , stayed calm in a nervy third-set tie break against Rosset . 
00300030000000078000000000030

" I 'm pleased because I did n't play that great today , but I fought really well , " he said . " 
000000000000000000000000

When I was down 2-5 in the tiebreak ( in the third set ) , I just thought about winning my two serves and hoped that he might get tight . 
0000000000000000000000000000000

Then he shanked a forehand at to make it 5-all and that helped me back . "

Nigerian Major General Sam Victor Malu took over on Thursday as commander of the ECOMOG peacekeeping force in Liberia , two days after the start of the latest ceasefire in the six-year civil war . 
70034400000000100050000000000000000

Malu replaced another Nigerian major general , John Inienger , who told officers at the handover ceremony that peace was now at hand for Liberia after six years of fighting and more than a dozen failed accords . 
30070003400000000000000050000000000000

" The search for peace in Liberia has been difficult , challenging and sometimes painful . 
0000005000000000

Peacekeepers were harassed , killed and taken hostage , " he said . 
0000000000000

" It is difficult but I want to assure you that peace is in sight . " 
00000000000000000

United Nations military observers travelling to the western town of Tubmanburg on Wednesday to monitor the ceasefire were delayed by shooting along the highway , U.N. special representative Anthony Nyakyi said .

Faction leaders who agreed a new peace deal in the Nigerian capital Abuja on Saturday have accused each other of breaking the ceasefire .

The West African state of Guinea declared Thursday and Friday days of national prayer .

A government statement , broadcast repeatedly by state radio , said the two days of prayer were " for the dead , for peace and prosperity in Guinea , the victory of the new government and the health of the head of state " . 
000000000000000000000000000500000000000000000

The precise reason for the call was not immediately clear . 
00000000000

Guinea 's president , Lansana Conte , vice-president of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference , left for Kuwait on August 16 to prepare the next OIC summit in Pakistan in 1997 .

Koranic reading sessions and prayers were to be held in the farming town of Badi-Tondon , near his home about 60 km ( 40 miles ) from the capital Conakry . 
7000000000000050000000000000050

Conte , an army general , survived a February army pay revolt which at the time he described as a veiled attempt to topple him .

He has since named a prime minister for the first time since early in his rule and ordered a crackdown on corruption .

Peruvian guerrillas killed one man and took eight people hostage after taking over a village in the country 's northeastern jungle region , anti- terrorist police sources said on Wednesday . 
7000000000000000000000000000000

For three hours on Tuesday , around 100 members of the Maoist rebel group Shining Path took control of Alomella Robles , a small village about 345 miles ( 550 km ) northeast of Lima , the sources said . 
0000000000070012000560000000000000500000

Some guerrillas made villagers listen to propaganda speeches in the village centre , others forced passing motorists out of their cars and daubed their vehicles with slogans . 
0000000000000000000000000000

By Wednesday , the whereabouts of the eight hostages was still not known , the sources said . 
000000000000000000

In recent months the Shining Path , severely weakened since the 1992 capture of its leader Abimael Guzman , has been stepping up both its military and propaganda activities .

Flamboyant former Surinamese rebel leader Ronny Brunswijk was in custody on Wednesday charged with attempted murder , police said . 
00700340000000000000

Brunswijk turned himself into police after Freddy Pinas , a Surinamese-born visitor from the Netherlands , accused Brunswijk of trying to kill him on Sunday after a bar-room brawl in the small mining town of Moengo , about 56 miles ( 90 km ) east of Paramaribo , said police spokesman Ro Gajadhar . 
300000340070005003000000000000000005000000000050000340

Pinas , showing cuts and bruises on his face , told reporters the former head of the feared Jungle Command had tried and failed to shoot him after Pinas objected to Brunswijk 's advances toward his wife . 
30000000000000000012000000003003000000

Pinas said Brunswijk then ordered his bodyguards to beat him up . 
303000000000

Brunswijk , 35 , denied the charges and said he had merely defended himself when Pinas attacked him with a bottle . 
3000000000000003000000

It was the second time Brunswijk had been charged with attempted murder in less than two years . 
000003000000000000

In 1994 he served two months in prison for shooting a thief in the buttocks . 
0000000000000000

Brunswijk led a rebel group of about 1,000 in a 1986 uprising against the regime of military strongman Desi Bouterse . 
300000000000000000340

The conflict , which killed more than 500 and caused thousands to flee to neighbouring French Guiana in the late 1980s , eventually paved the way to democratic elections in 1991 . 
00000000000000056000000000000000

Despite numerous problems with authorities , Brunswijk went on to become a successful businessman with mining and logging interests .

The suspect said he was hired to make a wooden box from the planks in order to hide the heroin .

Police went to the house after receiving complaints of sawing during the night over the course of several days .

When they arrived to investigate , police saw people escaping from the back door so they decided to search the house .

Palestinians accuse PA of banning books .

NABLUS , West Bank 1996-08-22 
50560

A West Bank bookseller charged on Thursday that the Palestinian Information Ministry has forced him to sign an undertaking not to distribute books written by critics of Israeli-PLO self-rule deals . 
0560000001220000000000000007000

" They made me sign an undertaking not to sell the books to anyone at the risk of legal action . 
000000000000000000000

One official told me ' you have to either destroy the books or return them to Amman ' , " Daoud Makkawi , owner of the Nablus-based al-Risala bookshop , told Reuters . 
000000000000000050003400007500010

He said ministry officials made him sign this a few weeks ago after he brought about a dozen copies from Jordan of a book by Edward Said , a prominent scholar at New York City 's Columbia University . 
000000000000000000005000034000005660120

Said , a U.S. citizen of Palestinian origin , has been an outspoken critic of the 1993 Israeli-PLO self-rule deal and has written at least two books on the accord . 
3005007000000000070000000000000

On Wednesday a bookseller in the West Bank town of Ramallah said police about a month ago confiscated several copies of two of Said 's books on the Israel-PLO self-rule deals . 
00000056005000000000000300007000

Palestinian Information Ministry Director-General Mutawakel Taha denied that ministry officials forced anyone to sign any undertaking and insisted that the Palestinian Authority has no plans to censor books . 
12203400000000000000120000000

" There is no strategy to ban books or to suppress freedom of expression in any form whatsoever , " Taha told Reuters . 
000000000000000000003010

But Taha said that the absence of relevent legislations may have resulted in some mistakes by some security officials . 
03000000000000000000

" This may explain some mistakes against some journalists and writers , " he said . 
0000000000000000

Daoud said books by other authors , including British Journalist Patrick Seale , were also banned . 
30000000703400000

He said that security officials often visit his shop to make sure he was not selling the books . 
0000000000000000000

" I think this is a bad beginning . 
000000000

If we have confidence , why should we be afraid of the other opinion ? "

Egypt blames Istanbul control tower for accident .

The chairman of national carrier EgyptAir on Thursday blamed the control tower at Istanbul airport for the EgyptAir plane accident . 
000001000000050001000

Twenty people were injured on Wednesday when the EgyptAir Boeing 707 overshot the runway , caught fire , hit a taxi and skipped across a road onto a railway line . 
0000000017000000000000000000000

Chairman Mohamed Fahim Rayyan told a news conference at Cairo airport : " The control tower should have allocated the plane another runway , instead of the one the plane landed on . " 
0344000005000000000000000000000000

" The one it landed on is 2,250 metres ( 2,460 yards ) long while the other one if more than 3,000 metres ( 3,300 yards ) long and is less steep , " he added . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000000

He said a Turkish civil aviation authority official had made the same point and he noted that a Turkish plane had a similar accident there in 1994 . 
0007000000000000007000000000

The EgyptAir pilot blamed Turkish airport staff for misleading him . 
01007000000

The landing took place after a rainstorm . 
00000000

" Its not an accident . 
000000

It 's very wet . 
00000

The brake action is very poor and the tower said it 's medium . 
00000000000000

Egypt wants nothing to do with Sudanese rulers . 
500000700

CAIRO 1996-08-22

The Egyptian government will have nothing more to do with the Sudanese government because it continues to shelter and support Egyptian militants , President Hosni Mubarak said in a speech on Thursday . 
070000000007000000007000340000000

Egypt says the Sudanese government helped the Moslem militants who tried to kill Mubarak in Addis Ababa last year . 
50070007000003056000

It sponsored last week 's U.N. Security Council resolution threatening a ban on Sudanese flights abroad if Khartoum does not hand over three men accused in the Addis Ababa incident . 
0000012200000700050000000005600

The sanctions will come into effect in November if Sudan fails to extradite the men , but Sudan says it cannot hand them over to Ethiopia for trial because they are not in Sudan . 
00000000050000000500000005000000050

" We are still eager that nothing should affect the Sudanese people but we will not deal with the current regime or the Turabi front or whatever , " Mubarak told a group of academics . 
000000000070000000000003000003000000

Hassan al-Turabi is the leader of the National Islamic Front , the political force behind the Sudanese government . 
3400000122000000700

" I do n't want to go into more details than that but there are more details and they are bitter . 
0000000000000000000000

There are terrorists they are sheltering and they make Sudanese passorts for them and they get paid by them , " Mubarak said . 
000000000700000000000300

He did not say if Egypt would go so far as to break relations , a step it has been reluctant to take , ostensibly because it would affect ordinary Sudanese .

I expect the market to go as far down as 63,000 tomorrow if sales continue , " said Burcin Mavituna from Interbank . 
00000000000000000034010

Brokers said profit taking sales had come especially as the index approached the 65,000 resistance level . 
00000000000000000

They said the index could also rise towards 65,000 if the cheap share prices attracted buyers . 
00000000000000000

Miss Universe , Venezuela 's Alicia Machado , left New Mexico on Thursday , refusing to answer questions about her weight or claims she was told to either go on a crash diet or give up her title . 
780503400560000000000000000000000000000

Machado , 19 , flew to Los Angeles after slipping away from the New Mexico desert town of Las Cruces , where she attended the 1996 Miss Teen USA pageant on Wednesday . 
300000560000056000560000078880000

While Machado was not a contestant here , she came under intense scrutiny following reports she was given an ultimatum by Los Angeles-based Miss Universe Inc. to drop 27 pounds ( 12 kg ) in two weeks or risk losing her crown . 
0300000000000000000007812200000000000000000

In Venezuela , her mother told Reuters that Machado had a swollen face when she left home two weeks ago because she had her wisdom teeth extracted . 
0500001030000000000000000000

Marta Fajardo insisted her daughter , who weighed 112 pounds ( 51 kg ) when she won the Miss Universe title in Las Vegas in May , had perfectly normal eating habits . 
340000000000000000780056000000000

" Everybody has their own addiction to something or other but it 's not as if she eats cakes like crazy , " she said . 
00000000000000000000000000

Organisers flatly denied ever threatening Machado but immediately put her under wraps and blocked access to her . 
000003000000000000

Dressed in a black strapless evening gown at Wednesday 's pageant , Machado was clearly heavier than the contestants but still won rave reviews after her brief appearance on stage . 
0000000000003000000000000000000

" Are you kidding ?

Beauty queens are high-profile personalities in Venezuela and Machado 's alleged weight problem made front page news this week . 
00000050300000000000

It was an official of the Miss Venezuela Organisation who first said Machado had been told to lose weight fast . 
000000122000300000000

People close to her said she then eased up on her diet and indulged her passion for pasta and cake , but it was not clear how many pounds she gained and most people who saw her said she was still a long way from being fat . 
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Martin Brooks , president of Miss Universe Inc , said he spoke with Machado to assure her that organisers were not putting pressure on her . 
34000122000003000000000000

" She 's fine with it . 
0000000

She wished , as we all did , that it had n't happened but she 's spiritually and mentally terrific . 
000000000000000000000

There 's no problem whatsoever , " he told Reuters . 
00000000010

He said the lifestyle associated with being Miss Universe could make routine exercise difficult . 
000000078000000

" The problem is they travel so much and are so busy that the ability to have any type of regimented routine workout does n't exist . 
000000000000000000000000000

I dont know if Alicia is working out .

Defiant U.S. neo-Nazi jailed by German court . 
05700700

HAMBURG , Germany 1996-08-22 
5050

A Hamburg court sentenced U.S. neo-Nazi leader Gary Lauck on Thursday to four years in prison for pumping banned extremist propaganda into Germany from his base in the United States . 
0500570340000000000000500000560

Lauck , from Lincoln , Nebraska , yelled a tirade of abuse at the court after his conviction for inciting racial hatred . 
30050500000000000000000

" The struggle will go on , " the 43-year-old shouted in German before being escorted out by security guards . 
000000000000700000000

Lauck 's lawyer vowed he would appeal against the court 's decision , arguing that his client should have been set free because he had not committed any offence under German law . 
300000000000000000000000000000700

The German government hailed the conviction as a major victory in the fight against neo-Nazism . 
0700000000000070

Lauck 's worldwide network has been the main source of anti-Semitic propaganda material flowing into Germany since the 1970s . 
30000000007000050000

" Lauck possessed a well-oiled propaganda machine , honed during more than 20 years , " presiding judge Guenter Bertram told the court . 
030000000000000000340000

" He set up a propaganda cannon and fired it at Germany . " 
00000000000500

said Bertram , who also read out extracts from Lauck 's material praising Hitler as " the greatest of all leaders " and describing the Nazi slaughter of millions of Jews as a myth . 
03000000030003000000000007000070000

Eager to put Lauck behind bars quickly and avoid a long and complex trial , prosecutor Bernd Mauruschat limited his charges to offences since 1994 . 
00030000000000003400000000

He had demanded a five-year jail term but said he was satisfied with the court 's sentence . 
000000000000000000

Publishing and distributing neo-Nazi material is illegal in Germany but Lauck 's defence team had argued that U.S freedom of speech laws meant he was free to produce his swastika-covered books , magazines , videos and flags in his homeland . 
00070000503000000500000000000000000000000

Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said in a statement he " welcomed the prosecution and conviction of one of the ringleaders of international neo-Nazism and biggest distributers of vicious racist publications " . 
00340000000000000000007000000000

" It is high time he was behind bars , " the opposition Social Democrats said in a statement . 
00000000000007800000

Lauck , dressed in a sober blue suit and sporting his trademark Hitleresque black moustache , showed no sign of emotion as Bertram spent more than an hour reading out the verdict and explaining the court 's decision . 
300000000000700000000030000000000000000

But as Lauck was about to be led away , he turned to reporters and blurted out a virtually incomprehensible quick-fire diatribe against the court . 
00300000000000000000000000

" Neither the National Socialists ( Nazis ) nor the communists dared to kidnap an American citizen , " he shouted , in an oblique reference to his extradition to Germany from Denmark . " 
00078070000000070000000000000050500

That 's the truth . " 
000000

His attorney , Hans-Otto Sieg , told reporters outside the courtroom that the judges had not explained how a German court could judge someone for actions carried out in the United States . 
000340000000000000070000000000560

Bertram said Lauck was obsessed by Nazism and devoted his life to leading his National Socialist German Workers ' Party Foreign Organisation ( NSDAP-AO ) , which derives its name from the full German title of Hitler 's Nazi party . 
30300070000000122222220100000000070030700

During the three-month trial , the court dealt mainly with issues of the NSDAP-AO 's " NS Kampfruf " ( " National Socialist Battle Cry " ) magazine , filled with references to Aryan supremacy and defamatory statements about Jews . 
00000000000001001200012220000000070000070

The court rejected Sieg 's argument that Lauck 's extradition from Denmark , where he was arrested in March last year at the request of German authorities , was illegal . 
0003000300050000000000000700000

Lauck was also convicted of disseminating the symbols of anti-constitutional organisations . 
300000000000

He will probably be free in around two and a half years . 
0000000000000

The court ruled that the 15 months he has spent in custody since his arrest should be subtracted from his prison term .

Algerian security forces have shot dead three Moslem guerrillas suspected of killing a leading French bishop in western Algeria , the Algerian state-run television said on Thursday . 
7000000700000070005007000000

Security forces also arrested four other men sought for giving support to the slain Moslem rebels , the television said . 
000000000000007000000

The television , which did not say when the security forces killed the rebels , said the four arrested men confessed details of the assassination of the French Roman Catholic Bishop Pierre Claverie . 
0000000000000000000000000007780340

The 58-year-old Claverie was killed in August 1 in a bomb blast at his residence in the western Algerian city of Oran , hours after he met visiting French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette in Algiers . 
0030000000000000007005000000700344050

An estimated 50,000 Algerians and more than 110 foreigners have been killed in Algeria 's violence pitting Moslem rebels against the Algerian government forces since early 1992 , when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists took a commanding lead .

U.S. President Bill Clinton had to drop the resort of Ballybunion from a whirlwind Irish tour last year .

So Ballybunion is going to America instead .

Two residents of the Atlantic resort , where Clinton was to have played golf with the Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring , have been invited to the Democratic party convention in Chicago on August 26-29 . 
000050003000000070034000000700050000

They have been asked to bring with them the placards they waved when Clinton addressed Ireland at a packed ceremony in Dublin city centre on December 1 , last year . 
0000000000000305000005000000000

They read : " Ballybunion backs Clinton . "

We will be guests of the Kennedys , " said Frank Quilter , one of the two who have been invited to Chicago .

Bonn says Moscow has promised to observe ceasefire .

BONN 1996-08-22

Germany said on Thursday it had received assurances from the Russian government that its forces would observe the latest ceasefire in Chechnya . 
50000000007000000000050

Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said top Bonn diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger had been assured by senior Russian officials that the ultimatum to storm and take the Chechen capital of Grozny was not valid . 
1203400503400000700000000070050000

" The Russian side confirmed that the ceasefire is in place and they will keep to it , " Erdmann told Reuters after speaking by telephone to Ischinger , who had met the officials on a two-day visit to Moscow . 
00700000000000000003010000030000000000050

He returned to Bonn on Thursday . 
0005000

Ischinger is the political director of Bonn 's foreign ministry . 
30000050000

Ischinger said he met three Russian deputy foreign ministers and a vice defence minister , who confirmed Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov 's pledge that Moscow would seek a political solution under the aegis of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 
30000700000000000700340005000000000012222220100

" The ultimatum ( to storm Grozny ) is no longer an issue , " he said quoting Ischinger , who had been sent to Moscow by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel as his personal envoy to urge an end to Moscow 's military campaign in the breakaway region . 
00000050000000000030000005070034000000000500000000

Ischinger said the threat of a major assault to take Grozny had been the unauthorised initiative of the commanding general and not Moscow 's intention . 
30000000005000000000005000

The officials had been positive about Kinkel 's request on Wednesday that President Boris Yeltsin 's security chief Alexander Lebed should , on his return to Moscow , meet Tim Goldiman , the OSCE representative responsible for Chechnya , he said .

India says sees no arms race with China , Pakistan . 
50000005050

NEW DELHI 1996-08-22 
560

India said on Thursday that its opposition to a global nuclear test ban treaty did not mean New Delhi intended to enter into an arms race with neighbouring Pakistan and China . 
50000000000000000560000000005050

Foreign Minister I.K. Gujral was asked at a news conference if India 's decision to block adoption of the accord in Geneva would lead to an arms race with Pakistan and China . 
003400000005000000000500000005050

" I do n't see that possibility because India is not entering into any arms race , " he said . " 
0000000050000000000000

Our not signing a new treaty does not mean we are going in for any new kind of weapons , particularly nuclear . " 
000000000000000000000000

China , along with Britain , France , Russia and the United States , is a declared nuclear power . 
50005050500560000000

India carried out a nuclear test in 1974 but says it has not built the bomb . 
50000000000000000

Experts believe both India and Pakistan could quickly assemble nuclear weapons . 
000505000000

Gujral said he did not expect India 's veto of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) to damage bilateral ties with other nations . 
30000050000788807000000000

" I do not visualise its straining our bilateral relations with any country . 
00000000000000

The text has already been blocked , " he said . 
00000000000

Gujral said India would re-examine its position if the treaty , particularly a clause providing for its entry into force , was modified . 
305000000000000000000000

Asked what India would do if the pact were forwarded to the United Nations General Assembly , Gujral said : " That bridge I will cross when I come to it . " 
005000000000122203000000000000000

In a written statement released at the news conference , Gujral reiterated India 's objections to the treaty , under negotiation at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva . 
00000000003050000000000788050

" It is a sad fact that the nuclear weapon states show no interest in giving up their nuclear hegemony , " the statement said . 
00000000000000000000000000

Gujral said India had national security concerns that made it impossible for New Delhi to sign the CTBT . 
3050000000005600070

" Our security concerns oblige us to maintain our nuclear option , " he said , adding that India had exercised restraint in not carrying out any nuclear tests since the country 's lone test blast in 1974 . 
000000000000000000500000000000000000000

He said : " We cannot accept constraints on our option as long as nuclear weapon states continue to rely on their nuclear arsenals for their security " .

Britain says death of its citizen will sour ties .

A British minister expressed his government 's official disquiet on Thursday at the recent death of a British citizen of Bangladeshi origin at Dhaka airport . 
07000000000000000700700500

" I have told Bangladesh leaders that British goverment has attached serious importance to the resolution of the tragic death of Siraj Mia , " Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Liam Fox Fox , told reporters . 
0000500700000000000003400000000103440000

Siraj Mia died at Dhaka airport on May 9 during interogation by customs officials after arriving from London . 
3400500000000000050

His body bore multiple injuries , and his relatives complained that he was murdered . 
000000000000000

A post-mortem report suggested he might have been tortured . 
0000000000

But customs authorities said the passenger was drunk and died of loss of blood from a deep cut in his wrist after he hit a glass sheet . 
0000000000000000000000000000

Fox , who arrived in Bangladesh on Tuesday on four-day visit , said Britain wanted Dhaka to act seriously on the case . 
30000500000005050000000

" This is one of the reasons of my visit here ... 
000000000000

this is an important issue in our relationship " , said Fox , who is due to leave for Nepal on Friday . 
00000000000300000005000

Fox said the incident had strained relations between the two governments . 
300000000000

He said the Mia 's issue had been raised in the House of Commons . 
000300000001220

Fox said he had brought up the issue at every meeting he had had with government leaders in Dhaka . 
30000000000000000050

He said the Bangladesh government had assured him it was taking the matter seriously . 
000500000000000

" The British government wants a thorough investigation and a just outcome , " he said . 
00700000000000000

Fox said the British government wanted an end to the alleged harassment of its nationals at Dhaka airport by customs officials . 
3007000000000000500000

Bangladesh 's Criminal Investigation Department has charged two immigration officials in connection with Mia 's killing .

India 's Home ( interior ) Minister accused Pakistan on on Thursday of planning to disrupt state elections in troubled Jammu and Kashmir state . 
5000000050000000000050500

" It seems that from across the border there is going to be a planned attempt to disrupt the elections , " Inderjit Gupta told reporters in the state capital Srinagar . 
00000000000000000000003400000050

The local polls next month will be the first since 1987 in the state , clamped under direct rule from New Delhi since 1990 . 
0000000000000000000056000

India has often accused Pakistan of abetting militancy in the valley , a charge Islamabad has always denied . 
5000500000000050000

Gupta said there might be an increase in the number of people infiltrating the Kashmir valley to create disturbance in the region . 
30000000000000500000000

" We noticed among the people who come from across the border , there is a growing number of foreign mercenaries , " Gupta said .

India RBI chief sees cut in cash reserve ratio . 
5100000000

NEW DELHI 1996-08-22 
560

The Reserve bank of India governor C. Rangarajan said on Thursday that he expected the cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) maintained by banks to be reduced over the medium term . 
01222034000000000000000000000000

" Over the medium term , yes , " he told Reuters after addressing industrialists in the capital . 
0000000000010000000

He denied having said in a recent newspaper interview that the CRR could be raised if necessary . 
000000000000000000

He said he was only trying ( in that newspaper report ) to explain the theoretical position on the use of the CRR by central banks to manage money supply . 
0000000000000000000000000000000

Rangarajan explained that the cash reserve ratio was an instrument that central banks could use to regulate money supply by reducing or increasing the ratio . 
30000000000000000000000000

But in the current context , the government stood by an earlier commitment to reduce it over a period of time , he said in response to a question .

BOMBAY 1996-08-22

The Reserve Bank of India Governor Chakravarty Rangarajan said on Thursday that a current account deficit of two percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) was sustainable given the currrent rate of growth . 
01222034000000000000000000000000000

" The current account deficit of around two percent of GDP is a sustainable level of deficit given the expected real growth rate and the trends in imports and exports , " Rangarajan said in an address to business leaders in New Delhi . 
00000000000000000000000000000000300000000560

Rangarajan said a current account deficit of two percent brought about by a 16-17 percent annual growth in exports and a 14-15 percent rise in imports along with an increase in non-debt flows could lead to a reduction in the debt-service ratio to below 20 percent over the next five years .

Mother Teresa devoted to world 's poor .

CALCUTTA 1996-08-22 
50

Mother Teresa , known as the Saint of the Gutters , won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for bringing hope and dignity to millions of poor , unwanted people with her simple message : " The poor must know that we love them . " 
3400003444000788000000000000000000000000000000

While the world heaps honours on her and even regards her as a living saint , the nun of Albanian descent maintains she is merely doing God 's work . 
000000000000000000070000003000

" It gives me great joy and fulfilment to love and care for the poor and neglected , " she said . " 
00000000000000000000000

The poor do not need our sympathy and pity . 
0000000000

They need our love and compassion . " 
00000000

The diminutive Roman Catholic missionary was on respiratory support in intensive care in an Indian nursing home on Thursday after suffering heart failure . 
007800000000007000000000

But an attending doctor said Mother Teresa , who turns 86 next Tuesday , was conscious and in stable condition . 
000003400000000000000

The task Mother Teresa began alone in 1949 in the slums of densely-populated Calcutta , and grew to touch the hearts of people around the world . 
003400000000050000000000000

When in 1979 she was told she had won the Nobel Peace Prize , she said characteristically : " I am unworthy . " 
000000000078800000000000

The world disagreed , showering more than 80 national and international honours on her including the Bharat Ratna , or Jewel of India , the country 's highest civilian award . 
0000000000000000780078800000000

Her health began to deteriorate in 1989 when she was fitted with a heart pacemaker . 
0000000000000000

A year later , the Vatican announced she was stepping down as Superior of her Missionaries of Charity order . 
00000500000000012200

More than 100 delegates flew in from around the world to elect a successor . 
000000000000000

They could not agree , so asked her to stay on . 
000000000000

She agreed . 
000

In 1991 , Mother Teresa was treated at a California hospital for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia . 
000340000500000000

In 1993 , she fell in Rome and broke three ribs . 
000000500000

In August the same year , while in New Delhi to receive yet another award , she developed malaria , complicated by her heart and lung problems . 
0000000056000000000000000000

Last April she fractured her left collar bone . 
000000000

But her increasing frailty , arthritis and failing eyesight has not stopped her travels around the world to mingle with the poor and desperate . 
0000000000000000000000000

Mother Teresa was born Agnes Goinxha Bejaxhiu to Albanian parents in Skopje , in what was then Serbia , on August 27 , 1910 . 
3400344070050000050000000

She attended a government school and was already deeply religious by the time she was 12 . 
00000000000000000

At the age of 18 she became a Loretto nun , hoping to work at the Order 's Calcutta mission . 
000000007000000000500

She was sent to Loretto Abbey in Dublin and from there to India to begin her novitiate and teach geography at a convent school in Calcutta . 
000056050000500000000000050

She said her divine call to work among the poor came in September , 1946 . " 
00000000000000000

The message was quite clear , " she told one interviewer . " 
0000000000000

I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them . 
000000000000000

It was an order . 
00000

I knew where I belonged . " 
0000000

The Vatican and the mother superior in Dublin approved and after intensive training as a nurse with American missionaries she opened her first Calcutta slum school in December 1949 . 
050000050000000007000005000000

She took the name of Teresa , after France 's Saint Therese of the Child Jesus . 
00000300500300030

In India she was simply called Mother . 
05000030

Mother Teresa set up her first home for the dying in a Hindu rest house in Calcutta after she saw a penniless woman turned away by a city hospital . 
340000000000700050000000000000

Named " Nirmal Hriday " ( Tender Heart ) , it was the first of a chain of 150 homes for dying , destitute people , admitting nearly 18,000 a year . 
00560056000000000000000000000000

Her Missionaries of Charity , a Roman Catholic religious order she founded in 1949 , now runs about 300 homes for unwanted children and the destitute in India and abroad . 
0122007800000000000000000005000

In 1994 a British television documentary called the myth around Mother Teresa a mixture of " hyperbole and credulity " . 
000700000034000000000

Catholics around the world rose to her defence .

Media baron Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp Ltd reported lower than expected 1995/96 profits on Thursday , but forecast that the hit film " Independence Day " would help increase profits by at least 20 percent in 1996/97 . 
003401220000000000000000780000000000000

" From an earnings perspective , the current fiscal year has begun with great promise due to the hit motion picture ' Independence Day , ' " News Corp said in a statement announcing its results for the year to June 30 , 1996 . 
000000000000000000000078000120000000000000000

It said moderating paper prices and solid orders for advertising at its Fox Broadcasting television network in the United States would also help boost profits in the 1996/97 year . " 
0000000000001200005600000000000

A budgeted profit increase of at least 20 percent for the full year currently appears very attainable , " News Corp said . 
00000000000000000001200

The bullish comments for the coming year soothed analysts and most shareholders , who were disappointed by the lower than expected profit for 1995/96 . 
0000000000000000000000000

News announced pre-abnormals net profit for the year fell six percent to A$ 1.26 billion ( US$ 995 million ) and earnings per share dropped to 40 cents from 46 cents . 
10000000000070007000000000000000

Analysts had on average expected a pre-abnormals profit of A$ 1.343 billion . 
0000000007000

" The year just gone was disappointing , but the outlook for the current year looks good , " First Pacific media analyst Lachlan Drummond said . 
000000000000000000012003400

News Corp said strong performances in U.S. television and British newspapers were offset by lower profits from News Corp 's magazine and publishing divisions and further hefty losses from its Asian Star TV operations . 
12000050070000000120000000000012200

Higher newsprint prices hit profits hard . " 
00000000

Throughout the group , higher paper prices increased costs by over US$ 300 million , " it said . 
0000000000070000000

News Corp said British newspaper operating profits rose 10 percent for the year , as higher cover prices at The Sun and The Times and higher advertising volumes offset increased newsprint costs . 
120700000000000000012012000000000

Advertising revenues at The Times grew 20 percent . 
000120000

Analysts said sharply lower earnings from News Corp 's book publishing division and its U.S. magazines had been the major surprises in the results for 1995/96 . 
000000120000005000000000000

News Corp said revenue gains at its magazines and inserts division were offset by higher paper prices and lower sales at the U.S. TV Guide . 
12000000000000000000005120

News said dramatically lower earnings from the British arm of its Harper-Collins publishing division more than offset healthy results from its U.S. operation . 
100000070001000000000500

It said the demise of the Net Book Agreement had hurt the British operations , and weak performances from the San Francisco unit of Harper-Collins had not helped . 
00000078800070000000560010000

The minimum price setting expired last September when three publishers pulled out . 
0000000000000

But it was the bullish profit forecast for 1996/97 that took the spotlight in the market , with some analysts saying 20 percent may even be an understatement . 
00000000000000000000000000000

" If they 're saying at least 20 percent , then their internal forecasts are probably saying 25 or 30 percent , " said one Sydney media analyst who declined to be named . 
0000000000000000000000000500000000

News Corp 's shares were down eight cents at A$ 6.39 at 2.00 p.m. ( 0400 GMT ) in a soft market .

The Australian government 's plans to slash its budget deficit should make a useful contribution to national savings , the Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) said in its annual report . 
070000000000000000001222010000000

" The government 's announced plans to balance the budget , if realised , would make a useful contribution to raising national savings , " the RBA said . 
00000000000000000000000000100

The bank said there were concerns fiscal consolidation would unduly restrict growth , but evidence was ambiguous . 
000000000000000000

In its 1996/97 budget announced on Tuesday , the Australian Coalition government announced an underlying budget deficit of A$ 5.65 billion , and pledged to return the underlying budget balance to surplus by 1998/99 . 
00000000071000000070000000000000000

The budget deficit was A$ 10.3 billion in 1995/96 .

" Determined and credible efforts to rein in unsustainable fiscal positions ( are ) often rewarded by rising confidence , giving favourable effects on economic activity even in the short term , " it said . 
000000000000000000000000000000000000

" More generally , the long-term effects of fiscal consolidation are clearly positive , with higher saving tending to promote economic growth by raising investment and lowering long-term real interest rates , " the RBA said .

Power New Zealand said on Thursday that the Optimised Deprival Value ( ODV ) of its network at March 31 , 1996 has been set at $ 524.2 million , an increase of eight percent on its $ 486.5 million valuation a year earlier . 
122000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

00000000000000000000000000000000

It said the increase was consistent with the approach followed by other power companies and reflected the company 's new levels of preventative maintenance and equipment upgrading .

500000070000000050000000000000

Daniel Westlake , 46 , from Victoria , made the first sucessful escape from Klongprem prison in the northern outskirts of the capital on Sunday night .

He was believed by prison officials to still be in Thailand .

Westlake , arrested in December 1993 and charged with heroin trafficking , sawed the iron grill off his cell window and climbed down the prison 's five-metre ( 15-foot ) wall on a rope made from bed sheets , Vivit said . 
300000000000000000000000000000000000000000

The corrections department was probing the escape and had ordered all foreign inmates chained to prevent more breakouts . 
0000000000000000000

There are 266 Westerners , including six Australians , in the prison , most awaiting trial on drugs charges .

Ukraine celebrates five years of independence from Kremlin rule on Saturday , hailing civil and inter-ethnic peace as its main post-Soviet achievement . 
50000005000000000000700

Ukraine 's declaration of independence in 1991 , backed nine-to-one by a referendum in December of that year , effectively dealt a death blow to the Soviet empire and ended more than three centuries of rule from Moscow . 
500000000000000000000000007000000000050

Ukraine , with a Russian community of 11 million people -- the world 's largest outside Russia -- has avoided conflicts like those in Russia 's Chechnya , neighbouring Moldova , and the former Soviet republics of Georgia , Azerbaijan and Tajikistan . 
5000700000000000500000005050050000700505050

" Ukraine 's biggest achievements for five years are the preservation of civil peace and inter-ethnic harmony , " President Leonid Kuchma said in televised statement this week . 
05000000000000000000340000000

" Unlike many other post-Soviet countries we were able to deal with conflict situations in a peaceful and civilised way . " 
0000700000000000000000

But independence was initially accompanied by hyper-inflation and economic collapse , although there are signs of a turnaround . 
0000000000000000000

Inflation -- a hyper-inflationary 10,300 percent a year in 1993 -- was a respectable 0.1 percent a month in June and July and the economy has just begun to grow . 
0000000000000000000000000000000

Kuchma told a solemn ceremony at the Ukraina Palace on Friday that " there was a turning point " in reforms and that he expected a rise in the standard of living in the near future . 
3000000560000000000000000000000000000

" There is no doubt that economic growth has already started , " said Adelbert Knobl , head of the International Monetary Fund 's mission in Ukraine . " 
00000000000000340000122000500

The national bank and the government have every reason to be proud of their efforts . " 
00000000000000000

Central bank officials said on Thursday that a much-postponed hryvna currency would " definitely " be introduced before the end of this year . 
000000000000000000000000

It will replace the interim karbovanets currency , which was introduced at par to the Russian rouble in 1992 but now trades at almost 33 karbovanets per rouble . 
00000000000000070000000000000

Ukraine has repeatedly promised to introduce the hryvna but had to postpone the plans because of economic problems . 
5000000000000000000

Proud of its record in promptly joining both the Council of Europe and NATO 's Partnership for Peace , Ukraine caused a foreign policy wrangle this week , offending China by allowing a Taiwanese minister to appear on a public , if unofficial visit . 
000000000122010788050000000005000700000000000

China cancelled a visit by a top-level delegation in protest . 
50000000000

Kiev 's Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko said Beijing was overreacting . 
50003405000

But Ukraine , seeing itself as a bridge between Russia and the rapidly Westernising countries of eastern Europe , is looking West as well as East . 
050000000500070005000000000

" The strategic aim of European integration should not in any way damage Ukraine 's interests in post-Soviet areas . 
00000700000005000700

Relations with Russia , which is our main partner , have great importance , " Kuchma said . 
005000000000000300

" But Ukraine cannot be economically oriented on Russia , even though those in some circles push us to do that . " 
00500000500000000000000

Kuchma has said Kiev wants membership of the European Union , associate membership of the Western European Union defence grouping and to move closer to NATO . 
300500001200000122000000010

A message from the West this week from U.S. President Bill Clinton congratulated Ukraine on the anniversary , promising to support market reforms and praising Ukraine as a " stabilising factor " in a united Europe .

Oldest Albania book disappears from Vatican - paper . 
050005000

TIRANA 1996-08-23 
50

A 16th-century document , the earliest complete example of written Albanian , has disappeared from the Vatican archives , an Albanian newspaper said on Friday . 
00000000007000005000700000

Gazeta Shqiptare said the " Book of Mass ' , by Gjon Buzuku , dating from 1555 and discovered in 1740 in a religious seminary in Rome , was the first major document published in the Albanian language . 
120007880003400000000000005000000000700

" We Albanians , sons of Buzuku , believed our language had a written document but now we do not have it any more , " lamented scholar Musa Hamiti , told of the loss by the Vatican library . 
0070007000000000000000000000340000000500

Tirana 's national library has three copies of the " Book of Mass ' . " 
5000000000788000

There is nothing left for us but to be grateful to civilisation for inventing photocopies , " Gazeta Shqiptare said .

Russia to clamp down on barter deals . 
50000000

MOSCOW 1996-08-23 
50

Russian officials , keen to cut capital flight , will adopt tight measures to cut barter deals in foreign trade to a minimum , a customs official said on Friday . 
7000000000000000000000000000000

" We have always been concerned about barter deals with other countries , viewing them as a disguised kind of capital flight from Russia , " Marina Volkova , deputy head of the currency department at the State Customs Committee , told Reuters . 
00000000000000000000000500340000000001220010

Volkova said last year goods had been exported under many Russian barter deals , with nothing imported in return . 
30000000007000000000

She said the cost of such unimported goods was $ 1.10 billion in 1995 . 
000000000000000

Barter deals were worth $ 4.9 billion last year , or about eight percent of all Russian exports estimated at $ 61.5 billion , she said . 
000000000000000070000000000

" The cost of exported goods is too often understated , so the actual share of barter deals in Russian exports and the amount of unimported goods may be even higher , " Volkova said . 
000000000000000000070000000000000300

A few days ago Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree on state regulation of foreign barter deals , and Volkova said this " could substantially improve the situation " . 
0000703400000000000030000000000

In line with the decree , which will come into force on November 1 , all Russian barter traders will be obliged to import goods worth the cost of their exports within 180 days . 
00000000000000007000000000000000000

" If traders are late , they will have to pay fines worth the cost of their exported goods , " Volkova said . 
000000000000000000000300

Understating the cost of exported goods could still be a loophole for barter dealers , but Volkova said the authorities are currently " tackling the technicalities of the issue " . 
0000000000000000300000000000000

Barter has always been a feature of the Soviet Union 's foreign trade , but Yeltsin 's decrees liberalising foreign trade in 1991-1992 has given barter a new impetus . 
000000005600000300000000000000

A few years ago , barter deals accounted for up to 25-30 percent of Russian exports because " thousands ( of ) trade companies which popped up preferred barter in the absence of reliable Russian banks and money transfer systems " , Volkova said . 
000000000000007000000000000000000070000000300

" Now many Russian banks are strong and can make various sorts of money tranfers , while incompetent traders are being ousted by more experienced ones . 
000700000000000000000000000

But the current share of barter deals in Russian exports is still high , " she said .

LOS ANGELES 1996-08-22

Paramount Pictures is going ahead with a sequel to the Tom Cruise blockbuster , " Mission : Impossible " and hopes to release it in the summer of 1998 , Daily Variety reported in its Friday edition . 
12000000003400078800000000000012000000

The big-screen version of the spy TV series has grossed $ 175 million domestically since opening May 22 , and $ 338 million overseas so far . 
000000000000000000000000000

It 's the biggest success for Viacom Inc-owned Paramount since 1994 's " Forrest Gump " . 
00000078100007800

However , many critics complained its plot was incomprehensible . 
0000000000

Cruise will reprise his roles as star and co-producer , and will soon meet Academy Award-winning screenwriter William Goldman , who will write the script , the report said . 
300000000000007803400000000000

It said " Mission : Impossible " director Brian De Palma would have first crack at the sequel , though no deals have been made yet . 
000788003440000000000000000

Goldman , whose Oscars were for " Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid " and " All the President 's Men " , earlier this summer criticised some of the season 's blockbusters . 
3007000788888000788880000000000000

However , he singled out " Mission : Impossible " as an especially entertaining movie , Daily Variety said .

England batsman John Crawley was forced to endure a frustrating delay of over three hours before resuming his quest for a maiden test century in the third test against Pakistan on Friday . 
503400000000000000000000000005000

Heavy overnight rain and morning drizzle ruled out any play before lunch on the second day but an improvement in the weather prompted the umpires to announce a 1415 local time ( 1315 GMT ) start in the event of no further rain . 
00000000000000000000000000000000070000000000

Crawley , unbeaten on 94 overnight in an England total of 278 for six , was spotted strumming a guitar in the dressing-room as the Oval ground staff took centre stage . 
30000000500000000000000005000000

There were several damp patches on the square and the outfield and it was still raining when the players took an early lunch at 1230 local time ( 1130 GMT ) . 
00000000000000000000000000000700

When brighter weather finally arrived , the umpires announced a revised figure of 67 overs to be bowled with play extended to at least 1900 local time ( 1800 GMT ) .

SOCCER - SPONSORS CASH IN ON RAVANELLI 'S SHIRT DANCE . 
00000030000

LONDON 1996-08-23

Middlesbrough 's Italian striker Fabrizio Ravanelli is to wear his team sponsor 's name on the inside of his shirt so it can be seen when he scores . 
10703400000000000000000000000

Every time he finds the net , the grey-haired forward pulls his shirtfront over his head as he runs to salute the fans , and Middlesbrough 's sponsors want to cash in on the spectacle . 
000000000000000000000000010000000000

" Having seen Ravanelli celebrate his goals ... 
00030000

we thought it would be fun to have ( the name ) on the inside of his shirt , " a spokesman for the sponsors said . 
000000000000000000000000000

" It will give the fans something else to look at besides his chest . " 
0000000000000000

Ravanelli aggravated a foot injury in the 1-0 defeat at Chelsea on Wednesday and was given only an even chance of playing at Nottingham Forest on Saturday by his manager Bryan Robson .

30340500003034050000

" If you really look at the match , " said the 12th-ranked Washington after losing to the 70th-ranked Rafter , " I never really got a chance to play because he was serving big and getting in close to the net . 
0000000000000300000300000000000000000000000

" He was also able to handle my serve pretty easily because my ( first ) service percentage was only in the 40s . 
000000000000000000000000

Put those two things together and you get a loss . " 
000000000000

Rafter missed 10 weeks after wrist surgery earlier this year and the time away from tennis has given him a new perspective . 
30000000000000000000000

" Before when I was on tour , I always felt I had to be in bed by 9:30 or 10 o'clock and I had to be up at a certain time , " Rafter said . " 
00000000000000000000000000000000003000

Now I can go to bed at at midnight or wake up at seven in the morning . 
000000000000000000

I just do n't have as many set routines and it 's made me a happier person . " 
0000000000000000000

Martin was pleased with his victory over Pioline , his first in five meetings with the 11th-ranked Frenchman . " 
30000003000000000700

It 's always difficult to win a match when you lose the first set , especially against someone you have never beaten , " he said . 
000000000000000000000000000

" I got more aggressive in the second and third sets and the wind picked up and that also affected things because Cedric definitely went off a little bit . " 
0000000000000000000000300000000

The 26-year-old O'Brien , who won the ATP Tour stop in New Haven last week , has now won 18 of his last 20 matches , dating back to qualifying rounds in Los Angeles in late July . 
00300007800560000000000000000000560000

He ranks 76th after being 285th four weeks ago . 
0000000000

" I feel I 'm hitting the ball well even though I 'm having more mental letdowns than I did last week , " O'Brien said . " 
0000000000000000000000003000

But I 'm still competing well . " 
00000000

" I got a lot of first serves in , " said Enqvist about his victory over Korda . " 
00000000000030000300

I did n't miss that many shots and he was making the mistakes . " 
000000000000000

Still marvelling at an exciting 64-stroke rally he won in the last game of his second-round match against Javier Sanchez of Spain on Tuesday , Enqvist joked , " Today against Petr there were about 64 strokes in the whole match . 
000000000000000000340500030000030000000000

It was mostly short points . "

TENNIS - INJURED CHANDA RUBIN OUT OF U.S. OPEN . 
0003400780

NEW YORK 1996-08-23 
560

Promising 10th-ranked American Chanda Rubin has pulled out of the U.S. Open Tennis Championships with a wrist injury , tournament officials announced . 
00734000007888000000000

The 20-year-old Rubin , who was to be seeded 11th , is still suffering from tendinitis of the right wrist that has kept her sidelined in recent months . 
00300000000000000000000000000

Rubin 's misfortune turned into a very lucky break for eighth-seeded Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport . 
3000000000070340

Davenport had drawn one of the toughest first-round assignments of any of the seeded players in 17th-ranked Karina Habsudova of Slovakia . 
3000000000000000034050

But as the highest-ranked non-seeded player in the tournament , Habsudova will be moved into Rubin 's slot in the draw , while Davenport will now get a qualifier in the first round , according to U.S. Tennis Association officials . 
00000000003000030000000300000000000078800

Rubin is the third notable withdrawal from the women 's competition after 12th-ranked former Australian Open champion Mary Pierce and 20th-ranked Wimbledon semifinalist Meredith McGrath pulled out earlier this week with injuries . 
300000000000007803400703400000000

Men 's Australian Open champion Boris Becker will also miss the year 's final Grand Slam with a wrist injury .

Russia 's double Olympic champion Svetlana Masterkova smashed her second world record in just 10 days on Friday when she bettered the mark for the women 's 1,000 metres . 
500703400000000000000000000000

After breaking the world record for the women 's mile in Zurich last Wednesday , the Olympic 800 and 1,500 metres champion clocked two minutes 28.98 seconds over 1,000 at the Brussels grand prix meeting . 
000000000005000070000000000000050000

The Russian ate up the ground in a swift last lap to shave 0.36 seconds off the previous best of 2:29.34 set by Mozambique 's Maria Mutola in the same stadium in August last year . 
070000000000000000000005034000000000

Former world 800 champion Mutola pushed Masterkova all the way , finishing second in 2:29.66 . 
0000303000000000

But it was the Russian who picked up the bonus of $ 25,000 for the historic run in front of a capacity 40,000 crowd . 
0000700000000000000000000

Masterkova dominated the middle-distance races at the recent Atlanta Games following her return to competition this season after a three-year maternity break . 
30000000780000000000000

In her first mile race at the richest meeting in Zurich last Wednesday , she slashed 3.05 seconds off the previous record . 
00000000005000000000000

The record of four minutes , 12.56 seconds in Zurich earned Masterkova a bonus of $ 50,000 plus one kilo of gold . 
00000000050300000000000

After Friday 's performance the Russian will have earned well over $ 100,000 in less than a fortnight , taking her appearance money into account . 
00000700000000000000000000

Brussels organisers had laid a new track for the meeting comparable to the surface at the Atlanta Games but put down on a softer surface . 
50000000000000007800000000

Masterkova clearly enjoyed it .

Mutola looked threatening in the final 200 metres but the Russian found an extra gear to power home several strides ahead , pointing at the time on the clock with delight as she crossed the line .

American Dennis Mitchell upstaged a trio of past and present Olympic 100 metres champions on Friday with a storming victory at the Brussels grand prix . 
73400000007000000000005000

Sporting his customary bright green outfit , the U.S. champion clocked 10.03 seconds despite damp conditions to take the scalp of Canada 's reigning Olympic champion Donovan Bailey , 1992 champion Linford Christie of Britain and American 1984 and 1988 champion Carl Lewis . 
10000000500000000000050070340003405070000340

Mitchell also beat world and Olympic champion Bailey at the most lucrative meeting in the sport in Zurich last week . 
300007030000000005000

The American , who finished fourth at the Atlanta Games , was fast out of his blocks and held off Bailey 's late burst in the final 20 metres before heading off for a lap of celebration . 
07000000780000000000300000000000000000

The Canadian was second in 10.09 with Lewis third in 10.10 , ahead of Atlanta bronze medallist Ato Boldon who clocked 10.12 in fourth . 
0700000300000050034000000

Christie , competing in what is expected to be his last major international meeting , finished fifth in 10.14 . 
30000000000000000000

Lewis , making a rare appearance in Europe in a sprint race , left the track with a slight limp . 
300000050000000000000

American Olympic high hurdles champion Allen Johnson defied the wet conditions to produce a brilliant 12.92 seconds in the 110 metres race , just 0.01 outside the world record held by Britain 's Colin Jackson . 
780003400000000000000000000000050340

Johnson ran the same time at the U.S. Olympic trials in Atlanta in June to become the second equal fastest hurdler of all time with American Roger Kingdom . 
30000005700500000000000007340

He seemed to relish the new track at the Brussels meeting , dominating the race from start to finish with a slight wind at his back . 
000000000500000000000000000

Jackson , the only man to have run faster , could not live with his speed , taking second in 13.24 seconds . 
30000000000000000000000

The rain was pelting down when the women 's high hurdlers stepped up for their 100 metres race . 
0000000000000000000

But Sweden 's Olympic high hurdles champion Ludmila Engquist , who crashed out of last week 's meeting in Zurich after hitting a hurdle , also kept her footing perfectly to win in a fast 12.60 seconds . 
05070003400000000005000000000000000000

Olympic silver medallist Brigita Bukovec of Slovenia could finish only fifth in the race in 12.95 . 
70034050000000000

Jamaican Commonwealth champion Michelle Freeman took second in 12.77 ahead of Cuban Aliuska Lopez . 
710340000007340

The Zurich fall cost Engquist a shot at a jackpot of 20 one-kg gold bars which can be won by athletes who clinch their events at all of the Golden Four series in Oslo , Zurich , Brussels and Berlin . 
05003000000000000000000000000780050505050

Seven athletes went into Friday 's penultimate meeting of the series with a chance of winning the prize and American men 's 400 metres hurdles champion Derrick Adkins kept his hopes alive in the competition by winning his event in 47.93 . 
000000000000000000070000003400000000000000

American Olympic champion Gail Devers clocked a swift 10.84 seconds on her way to victory in the women 's 100 metres , the second fastest time of the season and 0.10 seconds faster than her winning time in Atlanta . 
7803400000000000000000000000000000000050

Jamaican veteran Merlene Ottey , who beat Devers in Zurich after just missing out on the gold medal in Atlanta after a photo finish , had to settle for third place in 11.04 . 
7034000305000000000500000000000000

American world champion Gwen Torrence , the bronze medallist in Atlanta , was second in 11.00 . 
70034000005000000

It was a costly defeat for Ottey since it threw her out of the race for the Golden Four jackpot .

- The Angolan Chief of State addressed a letter to UN Security Council proposing dates for the conclusion of the peace process in Angola . 
0070000000122000000000050

He proposed definite dates , August 25 for return of Unita generals to the joint army , September 5 for the beginning of the formation of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation . 
0000000000100000000000000001222220

0000000000000000000000010000000120

The president justified his proposal by the delays verified in the peace process , including the fact that areas under Unita control or occupation have not been effectively demilitarised , where the Unita military forces have been substituted by their so-called police .

The U.S. and Colombian governments reached an agreement that will allow AMR Corp 's American Airlines to operate three round-trip flights between New York and Bogota , the Department of Transportation said Friday . 
0507000000012012000000560500122000

Under the agreement , which followed talks in Miami this week , AMR also will be allowed to shift up to four of the weekly flights it now operates between Miami and Colombia to its New York gateway . 
000000005000100000000000000000505005600

The United States also will be able to designate one new all-cargo carrier for service between the two nations after two years . 
05600000000000000000000

Colombia was permitted to add a single additional round-trip flight to its current New York service , although it will not be able to do so while under Category Two ( Conditional ) status under the Federal Aviation Administration 's International Aviation Safety program . 
500000000000056000000000000000000000122078880

Colombia would be allowed to add new service when its safety assessment has been improved , the department said . 
50000000000000000000

With the exception of the new services just agreed to , the governments of the two nations have agreed to maintain their current level of routes and airlines for the next 2-1/2 years , the agreement said . 
00000000000000000000000000000000000000

The agreement resolved a dispute that arose in June when Colombia turned down American 's request to operate flights between New York and Bogota , a denial that prompted the United States to charge that the Colombians were breaking a bilateral aviation agreement and to propose sanctions against one of two Colombian airlines , Avianca and ACES .

On Wednesday Norman described this year as his worst on the professional circuit since 1991 , when he failed to win a tournament . 
003000000000000000000000

" My application this year has been strange , " Norman said . " 
00000000003000

Maybe I have n't been as keyed up as I should have been . " 
000000000000000

" Sometimes you do n't have it in your head to play . 
0000000000000

Maybe this was one of those years where I was there , but I was n't 100 percent there , and you have to be 100 percent to perform , " he said .

For the first time in Israeli history , an Arab team will take the field when the National League soccer season starts on Saturday . 
0000070007000000078000000

Hapoel Taibe fields four Jewish players and two foreign imports -- a Pole and a Romanian . 
12007000000070070

The rest of the side is made up mainly of Moslem Arabs . 
0000000000780

The club , founded in 1961 , has a loyal following in Taibe , an Arab town of 28,000 in the heart of Israel . 
0000000000005007000000050

But away from their home ground , they face unfriendly crowds who taunt the players with racist abuse . 
0000000000000000000

" The very first thing we thought about after we knew we would be promoted was the game against Betar Jerusalem , " said Taibe supporter Karem Haj Yihye . 
000000000000000000012000103440

Two weeks ago Taibe , coached by Pole Wojtek Lazarek , met Betar , a club closely associated with the right-wing Likud party , for the first time in a Cup match in Jerusalem . 
00010007340010000000010000000070050

Chants from the crowd of " Death to the Arabs " , and bottle-throwing during the game marred the match which ended in a goalless draw . 
000000000700000000000000000

One Taibe supporter required hospital treatment for cuts and bruises after a stone struck his head as he was driving from the stadium . 
010000000000000000000000

" We 're used to hearing the taunts of " Death to the Arabs ' , " said Sameh Haj Yihye , a Taibe resident who studies at Jerusalem 's Hebrew University . " 
0000000000000700003440050000501200

But we know that these are only words , nobody has died from hearing them and it only makes us support our team more vehemently . " 
000000000000000000000000000

The dusty town of Taibe lacks the amenities of Jewish communities and many Israeli Arabs have long complained of state discrimination . 
0000500007000780000000

" There are no parks or empty areas of land around here , so when we want to play a friendly game of soccer we all load up in the car and travel to Tel Aviv , " 60 km ( 36 miles ) away , Sameh Haj Yihye said . 
000000000000000000000000000000000056000000000034400

The town 's ramshackle 2,500-seat ground is accessible only by two dirt tracks . 
00000000000000

" We plan to build a 10,000-seat stadium , but it may well be situated elsewhere , " said club chairman Abdul Rahman Haj Yihye . " 
000000000000000000000344400

We will discuss this with the mayor and hopefully a new or refurbished ground will be completed by the start of the new year . " 
00000000000000000000000000

In the meantime , Taibe will play all their heavily policed home matches at the Jewish coastal town of Netanya . 
000010000000000700050

" We are Israelis , there is no question about that , " said Karem Haj Yihye , a hotel waiter . 
0007000000000034400000

" We do n't have any connection with the Palestinians , they live over there , " he said , pointing to the West Bank seven km ( four miles ) to the east . 
00000000070000000000000560000000000

" We do n't feel our club represents Palestinian Arabs , " said club chairman Abdul Rahman . " 
0000000078000003400

We are trying to do all we can to run a professional outfit , we are pleased at any support we get , but do not go out looking to represent the whole Arab world . "

100000000000700000000005000007801050501000000

They have not lifted a European Trophy since 1991 when they beat Barcelona in the Cup Winners ' Cup final , and their one and only European Cup triumph was way back in 1968 , when they beat Benfica of Portugal 4-1 at Wembley . 
000007800000100788800000007800000000001050050

Juventus have won the European Cup twice .

100000000000000050000000700000050000700

Rebel fighters and Russian soldiers said a ceasefire effective at noon ( 0800 GMT ) on Friday was being generally observed , although scattered gunfire echoed through the Chechen capital Grozny . 
00070000000007000000000000007050

The Russian army said earlier it was preparing to withdraw from the rebel-dominated southern mountains of the region as part of the peace deal reached with separatists on Thursday . 
070000000000000000000000000000

" There has been some shooting from their side but it has been relatively quiet , " said fighter Aslan Shabazov , a bearded man wearing a white t-shirt and camoflage trousers . 
000000000000000000034000000000000

Soon after he spoke another burst of gunfire rocked the courtyard where the rebels had set up their base and a captured Russian T-72 tank roared out to investigate . 
000000000000000000000077000000

The separatists , who swept into Grozny on August 6 , still control large areas of the centre of town , and Russian soldiers are based at checkpoints on the approach roads . 
000000500000000000000070000000000

" The ceasefire is being observed , " said woman soldier Svetlana Goncharova , 35 , short dark hair poking out from under a peaked camouflage cap .

A few helicopters flew overhead , firing off flares , but there was no shooting from the air . 
0000000000000000000

The truce , the latest of several , was agreed in talks on Thursday between Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed and rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov . 
0000000000000007034000340

The two also agreed to set up joint patrols in Grozny , but Goncharova said she was sceptical about whether this could work .

" We have to try it , but I doubt if this is possible with the separatists , " she said .

Jordan , which has blamed Iraq for bread riots last week , has asked an Iraqi diplomat to leave , official and diplomatic sources said on Friday . 
5000050000000007000000000000

The main Friday prayers in southern Jordan that were the starting point for the riots a week ago passed peacefully under tight security imposed by the army with only brief demonstrations reported . 
000000500000000000000000000000000

Adel Ibrahim , the Iraqi embassy 's press attache , was asked to leave " because he was carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms " , one source told Reuters , implying he was accused of spying . 
340070000000000000000000000000100000000

Ibrahim told Reuters by telephone from his embassy office in Amman that he " had not been notified " of any explusion order . 
301000000050000000000000

The government declined official comment . 
000000

Ibrahim 's assistant , Hussein Khalaf , was expelled earlier this year for similar reasons amid rising tension in bilateral ties after King Hussein began calling for change in Baghdad following top Iraqi defections in August 1995 . 
30003400000000000000000300000500700000

Iraq retaliated then by expelling a junior administrator working in the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad but has continued its policy of trying to avoid public conflicts with Jordan -- its only secure route to the rest of the world . 
5000000000070050000000000005000000000000

Jordan has accused Iraq and a local pro-Baghdad party for the country 's worst unrest in seven years which erupted after it almost doubled the prices of bread last week under radical economic reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund . 
50050007000000000000000000000000000001220

In Karak , where two days of riots flared last Friday , a few hundred young men lingered outside Omari mosque on leaving , shouting slogans for about 15 minutes . 
0500000000000000000500000000000

" Disperse , abstain from forming groups and help maintain order , " army officers , who has enforced a loose curfew since the riots , told the crowd through loudspeakers . 
00000000000000000000000000000000

The men shouted " Allahu Akbar " ( God is Greatest ) as a former Islamist deputy , Ahmed Kafawin , told soldiers the crowd would not cause trouble . 
000030003000000700340000000000

He had earlier mounted the mosque 's pulpit to demand release of detainees , an end to raids on houses and the cancelling of the bread price rises . 
00000000000000000000000000000

Armoured cars had patrolled streets in Karak , traditional bastion of communist ideology and Baath socialism that swept the region in the 1950s , and guarded entrances to the hill-top city famed for its Crusader castle before the prayers . 
0000005000000070000000000000000000000000

There was also heavy security in the crowded centre of Amman , where smaller clashes had erupted last Saturday , but Friday prayers at the main mosque ended quietly as police in full riot gear looked on . 
00000000005000000000000000000000000000

The Jordanian Arab Socialist Baath Party , which has one deputy in the 80-seat lower house of parliament , has denied involvement in unrest which it blamed on government policies and rising economic hardship . 
01222200000000000000000000000000000

A knife-wielding neighbour apparently intent on sexual assault invaded a teenage slumber party on Friday , killing one girl and wounding three others , police said . 
000000000000000000000000000

At about 4 a.m. EDT ( 0800 GMT ) , a group of teenaged girls were having the overnight party in the Camelot subdivision of this eastern Virginia city , when a man entered the house , wielding a knife , threatening to sexually assault the girls . 
000000070000000000000050000500000000000000000000

Detective Richard Black of the Chesapeake Police Department , said a neighbour , Curtis Lee White II , 19 , was arrested in the attack , but had not been charged by late morning on Friday . 
0340012200000344400000000000000000000

There were apparently no adults at the party as the father of the family who lived in the house was out of town and the mother died more than a year ago , Black said . 
000000000000000000000000000000000300

The detective said details were sketchy , but two of the teenagers were reportedly downstairs watching television when White allegedly entered the house and told the girls to take off their clothes . 
000000000000000000300000000000000

He said a male teenager sleeping upstairs reportedly heard the commotion and came downstairs and confronted White , who allegedly stabbed him more than once . 
00000000000000003000000000

The other teenagers also confronted the assailant and three girls , all under 18 , were stabbed , one fatally . 
000000000000000000000

" At least two of them were sexually molested , " Black said . 
00000000000300

He said all of the wounded teenagers were taken to a hospital but none of the injuries were considered life-threatening . 
000000000000000000000

Police said the girl who died was identified as Michelle Harper .

Asked about reports Egypt has set new levels for a vomitoxin in its purchase of U.S. wheat , the secretary said " I do n't know anything about it " but added that USDA officials were " looking at it . "

The Sri Lankan foreign ministry said in a statement : " The United States government sympathised with the current predicament Sri Lanka was facing . " 
07800000000056000000560000

The statement said the U.S. government " would do all within its prevailing legal framework to prevent the use of American soil to perpetrate violence against the democratic government of Sri Lanka " .

OPTIONS - Euro debt vols seen regrouping after fall . 
0070000000

LONDON 1996-08-23 
50

Implied volatility of European bond and interest rate options should stabilise around current levels until early next week after falling before and after this week 's German-led cut in interest rates , traders said . 
00070000000000000000000000700000000

" Volatility has come off a lot . 
00000000

We 're looking for it to stabilise now , " said one Euromark options trader at a U.S. bank . 
00000000000070000500

A trader at a Japanese bank said Euromark volatility now stood at 14.00 for September contract , 16.75 for December , 19.50 for March and 21.25 for June . 
00007007000000000000000000000

This compared with midweek levels , before the welter of interest rate cuts , of 18.50 for September , 20.00 for December , 22.00 for March and 23.5 for June , he said . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000

At 1347 GMT , December Euromark futures were trading at 96.78 , two basis points down on the day . 
00700700000000000000

He said the sell-off in June vols might have been overdone , which could offer value at current levels . 
00000000000000000000

He said caps and floors would be well bid after the round of interest rate cuts due to the fact these rates should stay low at the short end . 
000000000000000000000000000000

The size of the Bundesbank 's repo rate cut , to 3.00 percent from 3.30 percent , took markets by surprise . 
0000100000000000000000

" Volatility has a bid to it -- longer-dated volatility more than short-dated because the event people were buying for has passed and now perhaps people will sell some short dated vol and buy some long dated vol , " he said . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

" Long dated volatility has been low this year , so it is still at levels which are not historically high . 
0000000000000000000000

" It is not a dangerous level to own vol. You are not going to lose a lot and you could make quite a bit . " 
000000000000000000000000000

He said volatility levels should be stable until markets reassess the situation after a long weekend in Britain . 
0000000000000000050

Paribas Capital Markets OTC options specialist Robert Coughlan said that if volatility continued lower for the rest of Friday in over-the-counter 10-year Bunds , it should be higher next Tuesday . 
1222003400000000000000700000000

He said the absence on holiday of many market makers was a main factor behind falls this week in volatility in high-yielding markets such as Italy , Spain and Sweden . 
0000000000000000000000000505050

Coughlan said the market had more downside than upside potential , but a fall was not likely to be of significant size . 
30000000000000000000000

" I recommend people sell strangles in a number of markets -- in Germany and France in particular . 
0000000000000505000

" With high-yielding markets Italy will be a lot more vulnerable in September on economic and political fronts , so I would use current the low level of vol to buy options . 
000050000000000000000000000000000

" So sell options on Bunds and France to enhance yield and buy options on Italy , " Coughlan said ..

Legal challenge to Diana delayed by jail term . 
000300000

LONDON 1996-08-23 
50

A British photographer branded a stalker by Princess Diana has been forced to postpone a legal challenge to a ban on approaching her because he 's been jailed for criminal damage , his lawyer said on Friday . 
07000000300000000000000000000000000000

Martin Stenning started a 12-week jail sentence on Thursday just as he was preparing to contest an injunction obtained by Diana banning him from coming within 300 metres ( yards ) of her . 
3400000000000000000030000000000000

" We were in the process of preparing a detailed affidavit responding to the Princess 's affadavit and expected to go to court in the next couple of weeks , " said Stenning 's lawyer , Benedict Birnberg . " 
0000000000000000000000000000000030003400

But everything has been put on ice now . " 
0000000000

Birnberg told Reuters that the challenge to the injunction would be delayed until Stenning was released . 
30100000000003000

Stenning threw a brick through the window of a van in February after an argument with a driver when he was working as a motorcycle dispatch rider . 
3000000000000000000000000000

Stenning , who has previous convictions , is expected to appeal against the sentence . 
300000000000000

Magistrates also ordered him to pay compensation of 182 pounds ( $ 282 ) . 
000000000000000

The freelance photographer was branded a stalker by Diana , whose divorce from heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles is due to become final next week , after persistently trailing her on his motorcycle . 
00000000300000030000000000000000

In an affidavit , the princess said that in chasing her Stenning had got so close that he twice smashed into her car and pushed her when she tried to remove the film from his camera . 
0000000000030000000000000000000000000

Stenning has rejected Diana 's claims and said he was being made a scapegoat to scare off press photographers .

Jordan has asked an Iraqi diplomat to leave the kingdom for carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms , an official source said on Friday . 
50007000000000000000000000

The move came after Amman blamed Iraq and a pro-Baghdad local political party for last week 's worst unrest in seven years after a government decision to double prices of bread . 
00005050070000000000000000000000

The government declined comment .

Turkish Kurd guerrillas said on Friday they would free seven Turkish soldiers they hold in northern Iraq under a tentative Islamist peace bid . 
780000000070000050007000

" ...For the sake of safety we are asking for their family members or the authorities to come and pick them up , " Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) central committee member Riza Altun told journalists near the Iraqi city of Dohuk . 
00000000000000000000000012201000034000070050

PKK guerrillas would accompany the soldiers , captured last spring in one of Turkey 's frequent cross-border drives , until they could be handed over , he said . 
10000000000005000000000000000

Their release has been negotiated by Islamist writer Ismail Nacar as part of a wider effort , partly backed by Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan , to find a political solution to Turkey 's Kurdish problem . 
000000703400000000000034000000050700

Erbakan has encouraged Nacar 's bid but has ruled out direct talks with the rebels .

A consortium of telephone companies and The Walt Disney Co . 
00000012220

said Thursday it had signed a $ 1 billion contract with Zenith to make digital televison set-top boxes for its home entertainment service . 
000000000001000000000000

The announcement of the contract for 3 million set-top boxes gave new hope to Zenith , which has struggled with years of losses . 
000000000000001000000000

" This really indicates we 're back in the business , " William Luehrs , president of the Glenview , Ill.-based company 's Networks Services Division , said in a telephone interview . " 
0000000000003400005070012200000000

Anytime somebody gets the opportunity to enter the next era with such a big bang has got to be seen as a strong message to the industry . " 
00000000000000000000000000000

Following the announcement , Zenith 's stock soared $ 5.50 to $ 16.875 on the New York Stock Exchange . 
00001000000000012220

The consortium , called Americast , said the contract was part of its strategy to develop and market the next generation in home entertainment . 
0000100000000000000000000

In addition to Disney , Americast 's partners are phone companies Ameritech Corp. , BellSouth Corp. , GTE Corp. and SBC Communications . 
00010100000120120120120

Americast said Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. has signed a letter of intent to join the group , which plans to provide a home entertainment service similar to cable television . 
1012222000000000000000000000000

Zenith also said it planned to build a new $ 100 million plant in Woodridge , Ill . 
100000000000005050

, to make picture tubes for 32- and 35-inch screen TV sets . 
0000000000000

The company currently buys the tubes from competitors . 
000000000

The new plant , which is dependent on obtaining financing , will create about 280 new jobs , Zenith said . 
000000000000000000100

The contract calls for production of the set-top boxes over five years . 
0000000000000

Luehrs said manufacturing will begin and revenue will start to roll in during the first half of next year . 
30000000000000000000

The boxes will be made on a build-to-order basis . 
0000000000

Zenith will convert its Chihuahua , Mexico , analogue set-top box plant to manufacture the digital boxes . 
100050500000000000

Luehrs declined to say when the operation was expected to be profitable . 
3000000000000

Americast will provide the boxes to subscribers as part of the service . 
1000000000000

Its service is being introduced in selected markets across the United States . 
0000000000560

Luehrs said digital technology in set-top boxes is only the beginning and said the technology will eventually show up in retail consumer electronics . 
300000000000000000000000

" We 'll build a lot of these devices into television sets , for digital television , " he said . " 
0000000000000000000000

Although that is not where this particular contract is headed , the fact that there is a strong Zenith presence will pay us dividends in the future . " 
00000000000000000010000000000

Zenith has been plagued by generally soft conditions in the colour television industry , reporting full-year losses since 1989 . 
10000000000000000000

Last month , it reported a second-quarter loss of $ 33.2 million , or 51 cents a share , vs. a loss of $ 45.3 million , or 97 cents a share , a year earlier . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000000

Last November , South Korea-based LG Electronics Inc. bought a majority stake in Zenith . 
000781220000010

Robert Gutenstein , an analyst for Kalf , Voorhis & Co . 
340000122220

, said the contract was " not unique , but it 's big . " 
000000000000000

" Digital is coming , it 's economic and the question is what will make the consumer happy and at what price . "

Natural Law Party says it can meditate problems away . 
1220000000

WASHINGTON 1996-08-22 
50

From the people who brought you hundreds of " yogic fliers " who claimed to defy nature by levitating comes The Natural Law Party , a minor political party that nominated a presidential candidate on Thursday . 
0000000000000000000012220000000000000

At a hotel convention here , the party associated with the Transcendental Meditation ( TM ) movement named physicist John Hagelin as its presidential nominee for the Nov. 5 election . 
0000000000078070000340000000000

The party is running on a platform claiming it can ward off problems before they occur through techniques such as mass meditation that would reduce stress , crime , terrorism and even wars . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000

" Social stress can be reduced and problems such as crime and violence will automatically decrease , " said a party paper . 
00000000000000000000000

Many party members are practitioners of TM , which involves meditating to a repeated word or phrase , called a mantra . 
0000007000000000000000

Some advanced TM followers contend they can actually mediate to such a point that they fly . 
00700000000000000

But in a demonstration of " yogic flying " several years ago , critics said the people were merely bouncing off the ground from a sitting position .

Huge Windows 95 sales fail to meet expectations . 
078000000

Martin Wolk

SEATTLE 1996-08-22

A year after its massively publicized introduction , Microsoft Corp. 's Windows 95 computer operating system has fallen short of the most optimistic expectations for the software giant and the industry . 
00000000120780000000000000000000

Even though more than 40 million copies of Windows 95 have been sold , making it the fastest-selling new software ever , it would have been impossible for any product to live up to the unprecedented hype of the Aug. 24 , 1995 launch , when stores around the world opened at midnight to greet long lines of customers . 
000000007800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

The Redmond , Wash.-based company spent tens of millions of dollars promoting the product with stunts that included buying the entire print run of the Times of London and lighting New York 's Empire State building in a Windows color scheme . 
030700000000000000000000012200560560007000

But the product , delivered eight months late , has fallen short of its sales potential in part because Microsoft delivered a mixed message to business customers , analysts said . 
0000000000000000000100000000000

" It did n't do as well as it could have , " said Rob Enderle , an analyst with Giga Information Group . 
000000000000003400001220

Scores of software and hardware companies that had hoped for a big boost in sales were disappointed when only a brief spike materialized . 
000000000000000000000000

" People who were expecting major coat-tails were somewhat disappointed , " said Scott Winkler , an analyst with Gartner Group . 
0000000000000340000120

" It 's not as though it has n't had an impact , " he said . " 
000000000000000000

It just has n't had the huge earth-shattering impact some people were looking for . " 
0000000000000000

Symantec Corp. , which had been among the most bullish of software companies at the time of the Windows 95 launch , ended up posting disappointing financial results when retail sales of the operating system fell short of its projections . 
12000000000000000078000000000000000000000

Touchstone Software Corp. had to pay $ 1.3 million in cash and stock to settle a shareholders lawsuit brought after the company 's sales failed to meet expectations tied to the Windows 95 launch . 
12200000000000000000000000000007800

Many software developers apparently saw their crucial holiday season sales suffer last year because store shelves were jammed with blue-and-white boxes of Windows 95 , resulting in a shortage of space for seasonal products , said Ann Stephens , president of PC Data Inc . 
000000000000000000000078000000000000340001220

To be sure , sales of Windows 95 and the accompanying Office 95 upgrade drove Microsoft sales up 46 percent last year to a record $ 8.67 billion and cemented the company 's status as the industry 's dominant company . 
00000078000780010000000000000000000000000

Microsoft executives say they are thrilled with the sales figures , and industry analysts estimate that by sometime next year , the installed base of Windows 95 will surpass that of the older version of Windows , now used on about 100 million computers worldwide . 
1000000000000000000000000780000000070000000000

But Enderle said the figure could have been even higher if Microsoft had done a better job of handling the huge demand for technical support from customers who were frustrated trying to install the system . 
030000000001000000000000000000000000

He and other analysts said corporate America adopted a go-slow approach because Microsoft already was promoting the new version of its high-end Windows NT operating system , expected to be available in stores in the next several weeks . 
000000500000100000000078000000000000000

" Microsoft sent a lot of signals that NT was going to be the answer , " Winkler said . " 
010000007000000003000

Many people began to believe that Windows 95 was being downplayed . " 
0000007800000

But now that Windows NT 4.0 has been launched , Winkler and others believe only a relatively small proportion of corporate users will elect to pay the added software and hardware costs needed to use it instead of Windows 95 . 
00078800003000000000000000000000000000780

" Windows 95 is going to do great , " he said . " 
07800000000000

The mistake people made was in thinking it was going to be a fast , sweeping change rather than a slow , building change . "

U.S. says still committed to Cuba migration pacts . 
500005000

WASHINGTON 1996-08-22

The United States said on Thursday it remained committed to migration accords with Cuba and would continue to repatriate intercepted Cuban migrants who attempted to enter U.S. territory illegally . 
056000000000050000007000005000

A State Department statement appeared in part a response to Cuban complaints that Washington was jeopardising the accords by failing to return some of the Cubans involved in recent illegal migration incidents . 
012000000070050000000000070000000

" The United States reiterates its full commitment to the implementation " of the accords signed by the two countries in 1994 and 1995 , said the statement by spokesman Glyn Davies . 
005600000000000000000000000000340

" The United States will continue to return Cuban migrants intercepted at sea who seek to enter the United States or the Guantanamo Naval Base illegally , " it said . 
0056000070000000005600566000000

Washington would also take " prompt and effective law enforcement action " against alien smuggling and hijackings from Cuba , it added . 
50000000000000000050000

Davies told reporters the statement would be distributed in the Cuban exile community in Miami " to remind everyone of the importance of abiding by the accords and avoiding dangerous attempts to cross the straits " from Cuba to Florida . 
30000000007000500000000000000000000005050

Havana 's complaints centred on an incident in which a boatload of emigrants capsized in the Florida Straits last week and two recent aircraft hijackings from Cuba . 
5000000000000000560000000050

Sixteen of those picked up from the boat were returned to Cuba but eight were taken to the United States and three to Guantanamo Bay , a U.S. base on Cuba , until they emigrated to another nation . 
000000000005000000560005600500500000000

The most recent hijacking , last Friday , involved three hijackers and the pilot of a small aircraft . 
0000000000000000000

Davies said on Tuesday the pilot could soon return to Cuba but U.S. authorities planned to try the hijackers . 
30000000005050000000

In an incident on July 7 , a Cuban interior ministry official hijacked a commercial plane and sought aylum at Guantanamo Bay . 
00000000712000000000560

Davies said he knew of no plans to return the man to Cuba .

Wis .

says is first state to apply for new welfare . 
0000000000

CHICAGO 1996-08-22

In keeping with its pioneering image in the area of welfare , Wisconsin was the first state to submit an administrative plan under the nation 's new welfare law , Gov . 
00000000000050000000000000000000

Tommy Thompson said Thursday . 
34000

According to a new release from the governor , Wisconsin submitted a plan to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for administration of the new block grant system for welfare just minutes after President Bill Clinton signed the measure into law Thursday . 
000000000500000122222200000000000000340000000

" As the nation 's leader in welfare reform , Wisconsin is far ahead of the curve and ready to go under this new system , " Thompson said . 
000000000050000000000000000300

Still , the governor said the new law does not go as far as the state 's own welfare reform program , dubbed W-2 . 
0000000000000000000000070

He said that despite the new law , Wisconsin will still require federal waivers allowing the working poor to acquire health care coverage from the state , a 60-day residency requirement for participation in the welfare program , and child support collections to go directly to custodial parents . 
0000000050000000000000000000000000000000000000000

The nation 's new welfare reform law limits eligibility , gives states more power and ends direct federal aid for poor children .

The next thing you know , the boxcar is coupled up and loaded up to a barge and headed north . "

State and federal agents on Thursday sifted through the rubble of two predominantly black Arkansas churches that burned within minutes of one another late Tuesday and early Wednesday . 
00000000000000500000000000000

Both churches were in the Mississippi delta region of Arkansas , about 90 miles ( 145 kms ) southeast of Little Rock , and were located within three miles of one another . 
000005000500000000005600000000000

" We 're investigating with the idea that both fires may be arson , but that has n't been conclusively established , " said Wayne Jordan , a spokesman for the Arkansas State Police . 
00000000000000000000000034000001220

Agents of the F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms were also at the scene , Jordan said . 
0001001222222000000300

Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church and St. Matthews Missionary Baptist Church were both frame structures , each near Turner , Arkansas , a small community surrounded by cotton and soybean fields .

" This is rural Arkansas . 
000050

I 'm surprised anyone could even find us out here , " said Fannie Johnson , a member of St. Matthew 's , who said she believed arson was to blame . 
00000000000003400005660000000000

Others connected with the two churches said they shared that suspicion , although all said they knew of no motive and no racial tension in the area . 
0000000000000000000000000000

" It 's sad someone would have that kind of spite in their heart , " said Rev. Jerome Turner , pastor of Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church . 
00000000000000000034000566660

Arkansas has been spared the loss of predominantly black churches to arson , a wave that has claimed an estimated 30 houses of worship across the south in the past several months .

Analysts hold Dutch PTT estimates . 
001200

AMSTERDAM 1996-08-23 
50

Dutch post and telecoms group Koninklijke PTT Nederland NV 's ( Dutch PTT ) first half results came marginally below most analysts ' forecasts , giving scant grounds to adjust full year estimates , analysts said on Friday . 
700001222001200000000000000000000000000

PTT earlier announced an 8.5 percent rise in net profit for the first six months of 1996 to 1.209 billion guilders , a hair 's breadth below the 1.210-1.236 billion forecast range . 
100000000000000000000000000000000

" They were pretty much in line with our estimate of 1.210 billion , " said Peter Roe , at Paribas in London . " 
0000000000000000340010500

As we expected volume growth was quite good ... 
000000000

there 's really no reason to change our forecast and our largely positive view on the stock . " 
0000000000000000000

" Coming just a million guilders under the forecast range is n't overwhelmingly surprising , " said ING analyst Steven Vrolijk , who is continuing to look for a nine to 10 percent rise in 1996 earnings . 
00000000000000000103400000000000000000

" They 've got a very sound domestic business which is doing very well , we remain positive on the stock , " said Roe . " 
000000000000000000000000300

We think it 's a solid performer in the Dutch market . " 
0000000007000

Roe said he was sticking by his forecast of a 2.45 billion guilder net for 1996 .

Sea lion paparazzi to keep tabs on whales . 
000000000

LONDON 1996-08-22 
50

U.S. marine biologists have trained a pair of sea lions to tag and photograph elusive whales as they cruise through the Pacific depths , New Scientist magazine reported on Thursday . 
5000000000000000000005001200000

James Harvey and Jennifer Hurley of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in California say their sea lions , natural companions of many species of whale , can go where no man or woman has ever gone before . 
34034001222050000000000000000000000000

" Any diver knows that when a whale gets going you ca n't keep up , " Harvey told the magazine . " 
00000000000000000300000

That is why we know only about five percent of what whales do . " 
000000000000000

The sea lions -- 17-year-old Beaver and nine-year-old Sake -- have undergone six years of training for their mission . 
00000300300000000000

Beaver once worked for the U.S. Navy and Sake is an amusement park veteran . 
300001203000000

Harvey said they could accurately tag whales with a radio transmitter , and could also swim all the way around one of the giant mammals , filming it with a video camera . 
300000000000000000000000000000000

Their first assignment , later this year , will be documenting humpback whale migration off Monterey , California . 
0000000000000005050

The article did not spell out exactly how the sea lions manage to tag the whales but said in training they were taught to stick a radio transmitter on to a plastic model of a whale using suction cups .

RTRS - Australia Senate jeopardises rate cut - Howard .

CANBERRA 1996-08-23

Australian Prime Minister John Howard said the possibility of lower interest rates was being jeopardised by Parliament 's upper house where opposition parties planned to scrutinise the 1996/97 budget . 
700340000000000000000000000000

" Every time the Senate hacks away at the budget , they hack away at the lower interest rate environment , " Howard told reporters on Thursday night after attending a Liberal Party function . 
00001000000000000000003000000001200

Senior ministers have repeatedly warned since the fiscally-tight budget was handed down on Tuesday night that the chance of lower official rates could be hampered in the Senate . 
00000000000000000000000000010

The budget contained sharp spending cuts in areas such as the labour market to reduce the deficit to about A$ 5.6 billion . 
00000000000000000007000

The conservative government 's plan for reform of the industrial relations environment and to partially sell Telstra has also been opposed by parties in the Senate such as the Greens and Australian Democrats as well as the official opposition , the Labor Party .

Students at South Korea 's Yonsei University threw more than just ordinary rocks at riot police -- some were samples that the geology department had taken 30 years to collect , newspapers reported on Friday .

Geology prefessors were quoted as saying that their collection of 10,000 rocks , gathered from across the nation and abroad , were irreplaceable .

" These are not like missing window panes or broken desks .

The won rose against the dollar on Friday as banks unwound dollar positions on the belief that the won would continue to strengthen , dealers said .

The won closed at 818.10 , after opening at 819.10 . 
00000000000

It ranged from 817.60 to 819.30 . 
0000000

" The dollar is overbought at the moment , " said a western bank dealer . " 
00000000000000000

The central bank 's insistent intervention just above the 820 level convinced players that it is serious about supporting the won .

China copper stocks owned by state reserve - trade . 
5000000000

HONG KONG 1996-08-23 
560

Up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses , confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate , probably belongs to China 's strategic state reserve , industry sources said on Friday . 
000000005000000000000000000500000000000

Around 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou , where some of the strategic stockpile was stored , they said . 
0000000000000000050000000000000

Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into Shanghai by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp ( CNIEC ) in June and July . 
00000000000000000000005001222222201000000

It was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve , administered directly by the central government 's State Planning Commission , owned the copper . 
000000000000000000000000000000012200000

Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise . 
00000000000000000000000000000

But one source , the head of a Hong Kong trading house , said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not . 
000000005600000000000000000

" If they spend all this money moving the copper to Yingkou , it will be sitting there for years , " he said . 
0000000000050000000000000

" Once it arrives in Yingkou , it is subject to monitoring by the State Planning Commission , which has to give permission for any more movement ; it is out of the hands of traders , " he said . 
00000500000000122000000000000000000000000

Mystery has surrounded the Shanghai stockpile in recent months , with traders unsure not only of who owns it , but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it . 
00005000000000000000000000000000000

Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) . 
0000000000000000000000000000000001220100

A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price . 
00000000000000000

CNIEC lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper onto the LME between April and June 1995 on behalf of the state reserve , running the state stockpile down to 115,000 tonnes from 200,000 tonnes previously . 
10000000010000000000000000000000000

Traders in Asia said CNIEC could well have lent it to the market at around US$ 2,700 a tonne , and then paid somewhere between $ 2,200 and $ 2,400 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year . 
0050100000000007000000000000000000000000000

This would have cleared CNIEC a healthy profit , which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs . 
0000100000000000000000

Word that CNIEC had offered the copper to European trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market . 
00100000700000000000000

Industry analysts Bloomsbury Minerals Economics ( BME ) said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the 85,000 tonnes , " whoever they are , is the most important short-term fundamental " in an already tight world market . 
0012201000000000000000000000000000000000

BME repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by Sumitomo Corp , with CNIEC said to be helping the Japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $ 1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals . 
1000000000120010000070000000000000000000000

Sumitomo and CNIEC have made no comments on the talk and Chinese traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement . 
1010000000070000000000

Traders in Shanghai said on Thursday they were unaware of movements out of the Shanghai bonded warehouses . 
005000000000005000

They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases . 
0000000000

They also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market . 
00000000000000000

But these concerns were irrelevant , a Singapore trader said , despite a forecast that domestic Chinese copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year . 
000000050000000070000000000

As with many commodities , " there is a desire ( by the Chinese government ) to keep a stockpile of the metal , " he said . " 
00000000000007000000000000000

You do n't keep it to help industry , you keep it in case of emergency . "

Newcastle 's early season teething problems continued on Saturday when they lost 2-1 at home to premier league pacesetters Sheffield Wednesday . 
1000000000000000000120

England striker Alan Shearer gave Kevin Keegan 's talent-laden side the lead from the penalty spot after 13 minutes after Wednesday 's Yugoslav Dejan Stefanovic pulled down Colombian forward Faustino Asprilla . 
50340340000000000000007340070340

But two minutes later Wednesday equalised through Peter Atherton , who found space in the penalty area to meet Mark Pembridge 's free kick with a precise glancing header . 
000010034000000000034000000000

Guy Whittingham stole three points for the Yorkshire side with a goal 10 minutes from time . 
34000001000000000

To add to Newcastle 's misery , England striker Les Ferdinand was stretchered off in the second half . 
0001000503400000000

Wednesday , who escaped relegation on the final day of last season , have now won their first three games of the season . 
100000000000000000000000

Elsewhere , title hopefuls Liverpool were held 0-0 at home by newly-promoted Sunderland , and in London , the tie between Tottenham Hotspur and Everton also ended goaless . 
00001000000010005000012010000

Frenchman Frank LeBoeuf and Italian Gianluca Vialli scored their first premier league goals as Chelsea beat Coventry 2-0 , and managerless Arsenal won by the same scoreline at Leicester .

SOCCER - DISAPPOINTING AJAX SLUMP 2-0 AT HEERENVEEN .

AMSTERDAM 1996-08-24

Dutch champions Ajax Amsterdam faltered in their second league match of the season on Saturday losing 2-0 away at Heerenveen . 
701200000000000000010

Ajax , who had a dismal series of pre-season results before beating NAC of Breda in their opening game , had the best of an entertaining first half but failed to break the deadlock . 
10000000000010500000000000000000000

Eight minutes after the interval , Heerenveen 's Romeo Wouden broke through the Amsterdam defence , left defender John Veldman standing and curled the ball beyond goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar into the Ajax net . 
000000103400050000340000000344400100

Ajax , without injured defenders Marcio Santos and Winston Bogarde and strikers Jari Litmanen and Marc Overmars , then stepped up the pace and looked certain to equalise . 
10000340340034034000000000000

But they left gaps at the back and on 73 minutes Danish striker Jon Dahl Tomasson rushed out of his own half , beat the Ajax defence and lobbed van der Sar . 
000000000007034400000000010003440

The defeat means Ajax 's main title contenders PSV Eindhoven , who beat the champions 3-0 in the traditional league curtain-raiser , can go three points clear of their rivals if they beat Groningen on Sunday .

British hostage in Chechnya describes ordeal . 
7005000

LONDON 1996-08-24 
50

A British aid worker , held hostage in Chechnya for nearly four weeks , said on Saturday a cocked Kalashnikov had been thrust into his mouth at one point during his ordeal . 
070000005000000000070000000000000

Michael Penrose , a 23-year-old worker with the group Action Against Hunger , described his ordeal to a news conference when he arrived back in Britain from Moscow . 
34000000012200000000000005050

" The worst period of physical manhandling was during that time when we were beaten with Kalashnikovs and at one point I had a Kalashnikov held to the back of my throat -- cocked , " he said . 
000000000000000070000000700000000000000

" For the first period we were held in a small room with no bed or anything . 
000000000000000000

We had very little food and sometimes went two or three days without eating . " 
0000000000000000

Gunmen seized Penrose , who comes from Swerford in southern England , Frenchman Frederic Malardeau and six other hostages from their car in Grozny , the capital of Chechnya , on July 27 . 
0030000500507340000000050000500000

The assailants had demanded a ransom of 300,000 pounds ( $ 465,000 ) but no money was paid by the charity when they were released on Wednesday . 
0000000000000000000000000000

The hostages were held in a house in or near Grozny which was bombarded regularly . 
0000000000500000

" During the last 15 days of being held , the fighting in Grozny was very close . 
000000000000050000

At first it was street fighting outside the house and then we came under very heavy shelling and bombardment from conventional weapons like tanks , artillery and grenade launchers , " he said . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000

Penrose had been working for the charity which provides food to civilians for only a few weeks before he was captured . 
3000000000000000000000

When asked if he would return to the mountainous region where rebels have been fighting Russian troops for full independence , Penrose said : " Not for the time being . 
0000000000000007000003000000000

I do n't think it 's safe for me . 
0000000000

But maybe in the future , depending on the circumstances . "

00000000000000000000000

00000000000000000000000000034000000000070340

The 85-year-old nun said in the past that she was praying for the couple , whose divorce is expected to become final next week .

The Zimbabwean government fired thousands of workers on Saturday for defying an order to end a strike which has crippled essential services and disrupted international and domestic flights . 
07000000000000000000000000000

The Public Service Commission ( PSC ) said in a statement that the workers -- including nurses , junior doctors , mortuary attendants , customs officers and firefighters -- would be barred from entering their workplaces on Monday . 
012201000000000000000000000000000000000

" All civil servants who did not return to work at their normal working hours , and remained working for the full working day on 23 August 1996 , have been summarily dismissed ... 
0000000000000000000000000000000000

with immediate effect , " it said in a statement . 
00000000000

Union officials from the Public Service Association ( PSA ) were unavailable for comment . 
000012201000000

Public Service , Labour and Social Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro told state radio her ministry had already begun recruiting other people to replace the strikers , sub-contracting some of the work to private firms . 
12222220500000000000000000000000000

The government had been threatening to fire the workers since the strike began on Tuesday , saying it was illegal . 
000000000000000000000

But the strikers ignored the threat and vowed to stay on the streets until their demands for wage rises of 30 to 60 percent were met . 
000000000000000000000000000

The stoppage has left essential services stretched with many hospitals handling only emergency cases under senior doctors with the help of army medical personnel and the Red Cross . 
00000000000000000000000000120

It has also disrupted flights . 
000000

Some internal services were cancelled , leaving tourists at the Victoria Falls resort stranded , and flights abroad were delayed . 
000000000056000000000

The PSA said 80 percent of the country 's 180,000 civil servants took part in the strike which is a rare challenge to President Robert Mugabe , who has been in power since independence from Britain in 1980 . 
010000000000000000000000340000000005000

Opposition parties , civic organisations and private-sector unions have expressed support for the action and denounced the government 's pay rises of up to eight percent for its workers . 
000000000000000000000000000000

Civil servants earn on average Z$ 1,000 ( $ 100 ) a month . 
00000700000000

They say their pay has not kept up at all with inflation , currently running at 22 percent .

Rwanda said on Saturday that Zaire had expelled 28 Rwandan Hutu refugees accused of being " trouble-makers " in camps in eastern Zaire . 
500005000770000000000050

Captain Firmin Gatera , spokesman for the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan army , told Reuters in Kigali that 17 of the 28 refugees handed over on Friday from the Zairean town of Goma had been soldiers in the former Hutu army which fled to Zaire in 1994 after being defeated by Tutsi forces in Rwanda 's civil war . 
034000077000105000000000000700500000070000500000070050000

Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo said on Thursday in a visit to Rwanda that his country would expell all the refugees back to Rwanda but he gave no timeframe . 
7003440000000500000000005000000

Zaire is home to 1.1 million Rwandan Hutu refugees who fled three months of civil war in 1994 . 
5000007700000000000

Many had taken part in the genocide that year of one million people , mostly Tutsis , and refuse to go home for fear of reprisal at the hands of the new Tutsi-dominated government in Kigali . 
0000000000000007000000000000000070050

Gatera said the refugees were handed over following a deal made at a meeting between the governor of Zaire 's north Kivu region and his counterpart in the Rwandan border town of Gisenyi . 
3000000000000000005005000000700050

" After a meeting between the governor of north Kivu and the prefect of Gisenyi , 28 prisoners ( refugees ) were handed over to Rwandan authorities on Friday , " Gatera said . " 
00000000050000500000000007000003000

Out of these 17 were former soldiers .

Revered skull of S. Africa king is Scottish woman 's . 
00056007000

JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-24 
50

A limelight-loving South African chief was in disgrace on Saturday after a prized skull he brought home from Scotland was identified as belonging not to his sacred tribal ancestor , but to a middle-aged white woman . 
0078000000000000005000000000000000000

A forensic scientist who examined the supposed skull of 19th century King Hintsa , a chief of President Nelson Mandela 's Xhosa tribe killed in battle by the British , said it was in fact the cranium of a European woman . 
000000000000300000340700000070000000000700

Chief Nicholas Gcaleka , dressed in animal skins and full tribal regalia , journeyed to a wintry Scotland in February on a hugely publicised quest to find Hintsa 's skull . 
0340000000000000050000000003000

The witchdoctor said ancestors had appeared to him in a dream and ordered him to return the head , said to have been carried off as a colonial trophy by the officer who shot and allegedly beheaded Hintsa after a battle in 1835 . 
00000000000000000000000000000000000003000000

But Gcaleka ran into trouble as soon as he returned to South Africa with a skull he found in a cottage in a lonely Highland forest near Inverness . 
03000000000560000000000050050

He said the spirit of a hurricane had guided him there . 
000000000000

Members of the Xhosa royal family , branding Gcaleka a charlatan , confiscated the head and sent it for tests to a forensic scientist , who examined the shape of the skull and the hole that he determined had not come , as supposed , from a bullet . 
0007000030000000000000000000000000000000000000000

" It can be stated beyond reasonable doubt that this skull is not that of the late king , " the scientist said in a statement .

Sudanese police have arrested three people trying to smuggle sewing machines and army clothing to Sudanese opposition groups in Eritrea , an official newspaper reported on Saturday . 
7000000000000007000500000000

The government-owned al-Ingaz al-Watani said the smugglers were caught in Banat in the eastern state of Kassala , on the border with Eritrea , and had confessed they were on their way to " the so-called alliance forces which have been undertaking subversive operations on the eastern border " . 
00120000005000005000005000000000000000000000000000

Authorities in Kassala said opposition forces based in Eritrea have been laying landmines and stealing vehicles and other goods to smuggle them across the border into Eritrea .

Albanian Socialists start landmark reform congress .

TIRANA 1996-08-24

Albania 's opposition Socialist Party began a two-day congress on Saturday to discuss major jettisoning its links with almost half a century of Stalinist dictatorship in the Balkan country . 
500120000000000000000007000500

" The congress will approve new concepts that will turn the party into a Social-Democratic and electoral party , not a class and ideological one , " the Socialist Zeri i Popullit daily said in an editorial . 
00000000000000000000000000000122000000

Jailed Socialist leader Fatos Nano made the first call for change in July , a month after the party 's chief opponents , the conservative Democrats of President Sali Berisha , almost swept the board in a disputed general election . 
00034000000000000000000007003400000000000

The Socialists , reformed heirs to the communists , pulled out of the poll saying it was a sham . 
00000000000000000000

Acting Socialist leader Servet Pellumbi has said he too will urge the party to scrap the ideas of Karl Marx at the congress . 
000340000000000000340000

The pro-reform stance of some of the party leadership initially caused a storm and triggered the resignation last month of the party 's Secretary-General Gramoz Ruci . 
000000000000000000000000340

More recently political commentators have reported a growing consensus , however , and a rift at the meeting looks increasingly unlikely .

King Birendra of Nepal has told China his nation will not become the tool of people who want Tibetan independence from Beijing , the official China Daily newspaper said on Saturday . 
03050050000000000070050001200000

King Birendra , in Tibet at the start of a one-week unofficial visit to China , said the Nepalese government had " maintained a sharp vigilance against such intentions " , the newspaper said . 
03005000000000500070000000000000000

Nepal shares a long mountain border with the restive Himalayan region , where opposition to Beijing 's four-decade rule is widespread . 
5000000007000005000000

Chinese official media has often accused foreign forces , notably the United States , of seeking to support Tibetan independence activists . 
7000000000056000007000

King Birenda told Gyaicain Norbu , chairman of the Tibetan government , that Nepal would not " become a tool for others to split Tibet " , the newspaper said .

Iran has hanged two drug traffickers in the southern city of Shiraz , the evening newspaper Resalat reported on Saturday . 
500000000005000010000

The two Iranian men were arrested in July with 419 kilograms ( 924 lbs ) of opium after they opened fire on police and killed a pedestrain and wounded four , the newspaper quoted a police commander as saying . 
0070000000000000000000000000000000000000

Resalat said the executions were ordered by the Islamic Revolutionary Court . 
100000001220

It did not say when they took place . 
000000000

One of the men , who killed the pedestrian , was hanged at the site of the crime and the other was executed in Adel prison in Shiraz , the newspaper said . 
000000000000000000000000500500000

Possession of 30 grammes ( just over an ounce ) of heroin or five kg ( 11 lb ) of opium is punishable by death in Iran . 
0000000000000000000000000050

More than 1,000 people have been executed in drug-related cases since the law took effect in 1989 . 
000000000000000000

Iran has an estimated one million drug addicts and is a key transit route for drugs , mostly opium , smuggled to Europe through Afghanistan and Pakistan -- the so called " Golden Crescent . "

Tunisia 's main opposition party on Saturday announced that it had been ousted from its headquarters building by a court decision for failing to pay the rent . 
5000000000000000000000000000

Mohamed Ali Khalfallah , spokesman for the Movement of Socialist Democrats ( MDS ) said that a bailiff who was accompagnied by policemen , on Saturday ordered the party to leave the building . 
3440000122201000000000000000000000

" We were not allowed a delay to enable us to transfer the movement 's goods and documents , " Khalfallah added in a statement . 
00000000000000000000300000

The building is state property . 
000000

The MDS was represented in court and admitted owing money for rent but did not give details . 
010000000000000000

MDS this year lost its president and vice-president , both of whom were tried and given jail sentences . 
1000000000000000000

MDS president Mohamed Moada was sentenced last February to 11 years in jail on charges of having secret contacts with Libyan agents and receiving money from Tripoli . 
1034000000000000000070000050

Vice-president Khemais Chammari last July was sentenced to five years in prison on a charge of disclosing secrets of judicial proceedings in Moada 's affair . 
03400000000000000000003000

To replace Moada , the MDS after the trial named Khalfallah as " coordinator " but Ismail Boulahya , the last of the MDS founding members still politically active , claimed the title of president , causing a new split within the movement . 
00300100003000003400000100000000000000000000

MDS was founded in 1978 by a group led by Ahmed Mestiri , who withdrew from politics in 1992 .

An Iraqi Kurdish guerrilla group on Saturday accused Iraqi government forces of killing two civilians in shelling in northern Iraq , the Iranian news agency IRNA reported . 
0780000070000000000500700100

IRNA said it was monitoring a report from a radio station affiliated to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) .

" Iraqi army heavily shelled the Kanie Karzhala camp , west of Arbil , on Friday ...

Two civilians were killed in the Iraqi bombing , " IRNA quoted the radio report as saying . 
000000700010000000

The PUK-run radio on Friday said Iraqi heavy artillery was pounding its positions in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq but it gave no details of casualties . 
0700007000000070500000000

There was no independent confirmation of the reports . 
000000000

The rival Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) , which accuses Iran of supporting the PUK , said on Thursday that its forces had halted an Iranian-backed attack by thousands of PUK fighters . 
0012201000050001000000000000000100

The United States said in Washington on Friday that it had brokered a ceasefire to end six days of fighting between the two main Kurdish factions and persuaded them to attend U.S.-mediated peace talks next month . 
0560050000000000000000007000000700000

The clashes , shattering a ceasefire negotiated last year by Washington , had threatened a U.S.-led peace plan to unite the Kurdish region against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . 
00000000005000070000070070340

U.S. , British and French planes have been patrolling the skies of northern Iraq since shortly after the 1991 Gulf War to shield Iraq 's Kurds from any attack by Iraqi troops .

Iran has accused Iraq of violating the ceasefire ending their 1980-88 war some 32 times between the end of March and May 31 this year , the Iranian news agency IRNA reported on Saturday . 
50050000000000000000000000070010000

Iran 's deputy representative to the United Nations , Majid Takht Ravanchi , made the allegations in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Friday , the agency said .

Clinton campaign busy making " news " .

WASHINGTON 1996-08-24 
50

President Bill Clinton has served notice he intends to be busy " making news " -- or at least doing things that look and sound like it in a campaign year . 
03400000000000000000000000000000

With Democrats gathering in Chicago to start a convention on Monday to nominate him for a second term as president , Clinton plans a steady parade of events designed to highlight his leadership and dim the glow of the just-concluded Republican conclave that gave a boost to rival Bob Dole . 
070050000000000000000300000000000000000070000000340

After a week of carefully orchestrated events signing into law bills passed by the Republican-controlled Congress , Clinton used his Saturday radio address to the nation to proudly " announce " a development in the war on crime . 
000000000000007103000000000000000000000

" Sixty days ago I directed the attorney general to draw up a plan for a national registry of sex offenders , " Clinton said . " 
000000000000000000000003000

That plan has now reached my desk . " 
000000000

" Today I am pleased to announce that we are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals , not just in a single state but wherever they go , " he said . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000000

Actually , creation of such a registry was underway without Clinton lifting a finger . 
000000000030000

Attorney General Janet Reno 's report -- all nine pages of it , including footnotes -- offers only the interim services of the FBI until a formal registry on sex offenders has been established . 
00340000000000000000000100000000000

Two months ago , Clinton announced he wanted an interim effort established . 
0000300000000

Now , 60 days later , he had a chance to talk about it again . 
0000000000000000

It is an example of Clinton 's strategic planning as he heads into the stretch drive for the Nov. 5 presidential election . 
00000300000000000000000

Such things do not happen by chance in the Clinton White House , they are part of his political chess game . 
0000000003560000000000

In the past week Clinton signed into law an increase in the minimium wage , a bill that makes it easier for someone with a pre-existing health problem to change jobs , and sweeping changes overhauling the nation 's welfare system . 
000030000000000000000000000000000000000000

" America can look back on a week of remarkable achievement , " Clinton said , without even a passing reference to the Republican majority in the House and Senate . 
0500000000000300000000070001010

" America is on the right track offering more opportunity , demanding more responsibility , building a stronger community , the sense of shared values and stronger families , " he said in striking the theme of his coming week . 
05000000000000000000000000000000000000000

According to a senior campaign official , Clinton " will be making a lot of news in the coming week -- something different each day . " 
000000030000000000000000000

Clinton departs on Sunday on a four-day train trip through West Virginia , Kentucky , Ohio , Michigan and Indiana while fellow Democrats are gathered in Chicago . 
3000000000560505050500700050

" He 'll make news during the day ... and then at night the attention will go to the convention , " said the campaign official . " 
0000000000000000000000000000

We think it 'll work really well . "

Although officials decline to say just what each day 's " news " will be , the intent is to put a focus on Clinton himself and not just those attending the party 's convention . 
000000000000000000000000300000000000

Each day of the trip will have a late start , so that network television correspondents will be able to do live reports for morning programmes . 
000000000000000000000000000

Campaign officials then hope the day 's " news " event will be showcased on evening television news shows as a lead-in for that night 's convention programme . 
00000000000000000000000000000

" We 'll be concentrating ... on supporting the president as he is on the trip and making significant public policy statements related to some of his plans for the future , " said White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry . 
00000000000000000000000000000000005600340

McCurry said that when Clinton delivers his acceptance address on Thursday night to fellow Democrats and a national television audience , he will " set out a road map " for the nation 's future -- one the president hopes guides him back to the White House for four more years .

Defence Minister Volker Ruehe said that German troops would stay on in Bosnia next year as part of an international force to ensure the establishment of peace , a newspaper reported on Saturday . 
0034007000005000000000000000000000

The current NATO-led peace force ( IFOR ) in Bosnia is due to return home at the end of the year . 
0070001005000000000000

But Ruehe told Bild am Sonntag in an interview that a " new and different mandate " for the troops would be agreed on for next year after the current mandate expires in December . 
03012200000000000000000000000000000

" After the ( Bosnian ) elections ( on September 14 ) the troops will start being reduced from the beginning of October from 60,000 to about 20,000 . 
00007000000000000000000000000

A completely new and different mandate will be agreed for next year , " Ruehe said . 
00000000000000300

" The defence ministers will begin negotiations for this at the beginning of September at a NATO meeting , " he told the newspaper in an interview , excerpts of which were released ahead of publication on Sunday . 
000000000000000010000000000000000000000

" But we must avoid giving the impression this peace deployment in former Yugoslavia is being perceived in the long run as an occupation . 
0000000000000500000000000

On the other hand we must prevent any return of war and massacres " he said .

Italian comics hope independence-joke 's on Bossi . 
70000030

ORVIETO , Italy 1996-08-24 
5050

A group of Italian comics hope the joke will be on separatist leader Umberto Bossi next month when they lead the ancient Etruscan town of Orvieto in a mock split from Rome . 
000700000000034000000070050000050

Orvieto mayor Stefano Cimicchi said the comics , including popular actor Roberto Benigni , would declare Orvieto " capital of Etruria " on September 15 -- the day Bossi plans a march across the north in favour of independence from Rome . 
503400000003400050005000000030000000000050

" We will then proceed with the annexation of Sardinia , Corsica and Cyprus , " Cimicchi told reporters on Saturday . 
0000000005050500300000

He said the city council would be " ironically present " when the comics made their proclamation on the same day Bossi has threatened to declare the birth of Padania , the name he has given to northern Italy . 
0000000000000000000003000000050000000050

Orvieto , located in Umbria between Rome and Florence , was once the capital of Etruria , an ancient federation of 12 Etruscan towns . 
5000505050000005000000700

" We want to pop some air out of this balloon of tension that has been blown up around September 15 , " Cimicchi said . 
00000000000000000000000300

" We want to help turn down the rhetoric in a country that borders former Yugoslavia yet in which people are still talking about secession , " he added . 
000000000000000500000000000000

Bossi has intensified his separatist rhetoric since his Northern League party 's good showing in last April 's general election , when it took 10 percent of the vote nationally . 
3000000012000000000000000000000

He has recently dropped a drive for federalism , saying secession from Rome 's wasteful and centralised bureaucracy is the only solution for northerners .

Italian farmer says he mutilated four women .

VERONA , Italy 1996-08-24 
5050

An Italian farmer accused of multiple homocide has confessed to mutilating the bodies of four women after having sex with them , the Italian news agency ANSA reported on Saturday . 
0700000000000000000000070010000

It quoted the lawyer of Gianfranco Stevanin as saying the 35-year-old farmer confessed on Friday to a Verona magistrate that he had killed and mutilated the women . 
0000034000000000050000000000

ANSA said Stevanin was unable to recall how he had killed the women , remembering only that he had found them " lifeless in his arms " after having sadmasochistic sex with them . 
1030000000000000000000000000000000

Stevanin , arrested in 1994 and jailed for three years for assaulting an Austrian prostitute , is accused of murdering five women , three of whose bodies were found near his villa outside Verona between July and December 1995 . 
3000000000000700000000000000000003000000

Two of the corpses were identified but not the third , found headless and decomposed in a sack in a nearby canal . 
00000000000000000000000

Lawyer Cesare dal Maso told ANSA that Stevanin confessed to beheading and dumping the body of a fourth woman in the nearby Adige river . 
0344010300000000000000500

Dal Maso declined to comment on the alleged fifth murder , saying only that " the interrogations are not over yet " with investigators . 
3400000000000000000000000

It said investigators believed Stevanin had suffocated them by putting plastic bags on their heads . 
0000300000000000

Stevanin was first sentenced for assault but investigators began digging in the garden of his villa after the first body was found by a passer-by .

Belgium asks how paedophile suspect eluded police .

Belgian police searched two more houses on Saturday for bodies in a child-sex scandal of murder , kidnapping and pornography that has sent a shockwave of revulsion throughout Europe . 
700000000000000000000000000050

Recriminations built up over how the scandal 's central figure , convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux , managed to prey on children unhindered for so long . 
000000000000003400000000000

In just over a week two young girls have been found dead , from starvation , two have been freed from a dungeon-like secret compartment and an international hunt has started for at least two others . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000000

On Saturday investigators with dogs trained to find bodies searched one house at Ransart and one at Mont-sur-Marchienne -- both suburbs of the southern city of Charleroi . 
0000000000000500050000000050

Both houses are owned by Dutroux . 
0000030

Belgian media speculated that Dutroux , charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children , must have had high level protection to molest youngsters . 
7000300000000000000000000

They put forward no proof to support the speculation , but seized on a comment by chief prosecutor Michel Bourlet on Belgian television on Friday night that he would chase down everyone involved in the case " if I am allowed to " . 
00000000000000000034070000000000000000000000

Bourlet said between 300 and 400 paedophile porn video tapes had been seized , some of which featured Dutroux . 
30000000000000000030

Dutroux was charged a week ago after police rescued two young girls from a concrete dungeon in the basement of one of the six houses he owns in and around Charleroi . 
30000000000000000000000000000050

Just a day later the national euphoria at the rescue turned to disgust as Dutroux led police to the bodies of two eight-year-old girls in another of his houses . 
000000000000003000000000000000

Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo , had been kidnapped in June last year . 
34034000000000

Dutroux said they starved to death nine months later . 
3000000000

He also admitted kidnapping two other girls , An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks , a year ago . 
000000003403400000

The fate of the girls is unknown , but there has been speculation they were sold into prostitution in Slovakia or the Czech Republic where Dutroux was a frequent visitor . 
0000000000000000000500560300000

Belgian police have visited Bratislava and will visit Prague . 
7000500050

Five other people have been arrested including Dutroux 's second wife Michelle Martin , charged as an accomplice . 
0000000300034000000

The others have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children or are suspected of criminal association . 
0000000000000000000

Dutch police are also holding a 74-year old Dutchman in connection with the disappearance of An and Eefje , although a spokesman said no direct link had yet been established . 
7000000070000003030000000000000

At least part of the speculation in the Belgian media of high-level protection for Dutroux and his accomplices is based on leaked documents cataloguing a high degree of police bungling , incompetence and indifference . 
00000000700000300000000000000000000

Among the revelations are the fact that the gendarmerie was running a surveillance operation codenamed " Othello " against Dutroux in 1995 -- when both Julie and Melissa and An and Eefje were kidnapped . 
00000000000000007003000003030303000

They show that the gendarmes were aware that Dutroux was building cells in some of his houses for holding children , yet this information was either not passed on to other police forces searching for the missing girls or was overlooked when it was . 
000000003000000000000000000000000000000000000

They also show that police investigating a theft visited Dutroux late last year at the house where Julie and Melissa were being held but accepted his word that the children 's cries they could hear came from neighbours . 
000000000300000003030000000000000000000

Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck has admitted that mistakes were made and ordered an inquiry at the same time as stressing there were no indications of a cover-up . 
10344000000000000000000000000

There is also widespread disbelief that no one appeared to question how Dutroux , an unemployed father of three with no visible means of support , managed to own six houses .

An Algerian newspaper on Saturday put at seven -- two women and five children -- the death toll of a bomb blast in a market west of Algiers on Friday . 
0700000000000000000000000005000

Algerian security forces said on Friday three women and two children were killed and five people wounded when a home-made bomb exploded at a market in the coastal town of Bou Haroun , 65 km ( 40 miles ) west of Algiers . 
7000000000000000000000000000005600000000050

The security forces also said a man carrying an explosive device also died after it went off prematurely . 
0000000000000000000

El-Watan paper said the blast killed seven -- a mother and her 25-year-old daughter , four young boys and a five-year-old girl . 
10000000000000000000000

Several people were also wounded , it said . 
000000000

The explosion was the latest in series of bomb attacks in Algeria 's four-year-old civil strife . 
00000000000500000

The government-appointed watchdog , Human Rights National Observatory , was quoted this month by local newspapers as saying about 1,400 civilians have died in bomb attacks blamed on Moslem rebels in the past two years . 
000012220000000000000000000070000000

An estimated 50,000 Algerians and more than 110 foreigners have been killed in violence pitting Moslem rebels against government forces since early 1992 , when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead .

Most Spaniards would support government talks with the illegal Basque separatist group ETA if the rebels renounced violence permanently , a survey published in daily El Mundo on Saturday said . 
0000000007001000000000000120000

While 57 percent of the population supported negotiations with ETA ( Basque Homeland and Freedom ) , 30 percent opposed it , the survey by the state-controlled Centre for Sociological Studies ( CIS ) found . 
000000000101222000000000000122201000

But 80 percent said ETA had shown little interest in achieving peace in the Basque country when it offered a one-week truce in July while continuing to hold prison officer Jose Antonio Ortega Lara , kidnapped in January . 
000010000000007000000000000000344400000

The problem of terrorism had neither worsened nor improved since the conservative Popular Party ( PP ) came to power in May , according to 56 percent of those questioned , while 22 percent said it had worsened .

At least 30 people have been killed and about 100 injured in the flood-hit Pakistani city of Lahore , newspapers reported on Saturday . 
000000000000007005000000

They said 461 mm ( 18 inches ) of rain had drenched the Punjab provincial capital in 36 hours , turning streets into rivers , knocking out power , water and telephone services , disrupting air and rail traffic , and sweeping away houses and cars .

A small team of engineers from Sun Microsystems Inc. 's JavaSoft unit said Sunday they have formed a new company , dubbed Internet Startup , to build Java infrastructure software . 
0000001220100000000000120007000

The fledgling company , established in a ground-floor office here over the last two weeks , has received venture financing from Bessemer Venture Partners of Menlo Park , Calif .. 
000000000000000000000122056050

David Cowan , Internet Startup founder and acting chief executive , is a general partner of Bessemer . 
340120000000000010

The startup company 's acting chairman is Jim Bidzos , the president of RSA Data Security , a unit of Security Dynamics Technologies Inc. as well as chairman of VeriSign . 
0000000340000122000012220000010

Internet Startup , which opened its doors with about half a dozen initial employees , combines experience at JavaSoft , Apple Computer Inc. , and Oracle Systems . 
1200000000000000001012200120

" Java portends dramatic changes in the way we use the Internet , " said Hong Bui , vice president of engineering of the new company after serving as a senior engineer at JavaSoft . 
07000000000700034000000000000000010

Java is a computer programming language introduced by Sun Microsystems in mid-1995 which has immediately captured the attention of the industry for its ability to operate across virtually all computer system in a relatively secure manner . 
7000000012000000000000000000000000000

Just last week , Sun Microsystems and the Silicon Valley venture capital giant Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers said they had completed financing of a $ 100 million fund managed by Kleiner Perkins to fund startups developing Java technologies . 
0000120056000122220000000000000120000700

Java has been licensed by nearly 50 organisations , ranging from Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. to the Taiwan government . 
70000000000120122200500

Prasad Wagle , another former senior JavaSoft engineer who is among the founding engineers at Internet Startup , said the new company aims to build software infrastructure using Java to make networked applications ubiquitious . 
34000010000000012000000000007000000

One feature of the Java language is that small software programmes , known as " applets " because they are small applications , can be downloaded from the server computers at the centre of networks onto individual computers for use . 
00007000000000000000000000000000000000000

In this model , individual computer users can always gain access to the latest programmes and do not need to store more software than they are currently using on their computers at any one time , also saving costs of memory and storage . 
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

MOTORCYCLING - JAPANESE WIN BOTH ROUND NINE SUPERBIKE RACES . 
0070003000

SUGO , Japan 1996-08-25 
5050

Teenager Yuuichi Takeda , racing in only his first season , outclassed the big names to win the first race in round nine of the world superbike championship on Sunday . 
0340000000000000000000000000000

Takeda , 18 , showed poise far beyond his years to overtake Australian Ducati rider Troy Corser , last year 's championship runner-up , with four of the 25 laps left . 
30000000000071034000000000000000

Honda 's Takeda was pursued past Corser by the Yamaha duo of Noriyuki Haga and Wataru Yoshikawa with Haga briefly taking the lead in the final chicane on the last lap . 
10300030010034034030000000000000

But Takeda found one more spurt of power to just take the flag first with Haga second and Yoshikawa third . 
030000000000000300300

Haga had the consolation of recording the fastest lap at 147.159 kph . 
3000000000000

Corser , who crashed during practice on Friday , limped in fourth , four seconds behind Takeda with championship leader Aaron Slight of New Zealand 11 seconds behind the winner . 
3000000000000000300034056000000

In the second race , Takeda again challenged strongly until the fifth lap from the end when he crashed while running second to eventual race winner Takuma Aoki . 
00000300000000000000000000340

Aoki , the elder brother of reigning 125cc world champion Haruchika , had a race-long duel with John Kocinski of the United States on a Ducati before taking the chequered flag . 
30000000003000000340056001000000

Kocinski led for the early laps before he was passed first by Aoki , who recorded the fastest lap of 147.786 kph , and then by Takeda . 
3000000000003000000000000030

With Takeda out of the race , Kocinski regained second place but he could not overtake Aoki . 
030000030000000030

Haga again was the unlucky rider finishing third ahead of Slight with Corser in 10th place . 
30000000003030000

But the strong showing by the Japanese riders did not alter the championship table with Slight still leading on 280 points , followed by Corser with 269 and Kocinski with 254 .

CRICKET - POLLOCK CONCLUDES WARWICKSHIRE CAREER WITH FLOURISH . 
003010000

LONDON 1996-08-25 
50

South African fast bowler Shaun Pollock concluded his Warwickshire career with a flourish on Sunday by taking the final three wickets during the county 's Sunday league victory over Worcestershire . 
7800340010000000000000000000010

Pollock , who returns home on Tuesday for an ankle operation , took the last three wickets in nine balls as Worcestershire were dismissed for 154 . 
300000000000000000000100000

After an hour 's interruption for rain , Warwickshire then reached an adjusted target of 109 with 13 balls to spare and record their fifth win in the last six games . 
00000000100000000000000000000000

Warwickshire are currently in fourth position behind Yorkshire , Nottinghamshire and Surrey . 
1000000101010

Yorkshire captain David Byas completed his third Sunday league century as his side swept clear at the top of the table , reaching a career best 111 not out against Lancashire . 
10340000000000000000000000000010

Lancashire 's total of 205 for eight from 40 overs looked reasonable before Byas put their attack to the sword , collecting his runs from just 100 balls with three sixes and nine fours . 
10000000000003000000000000000000000

Yorkshire eventually reached their target with only four wickets down and 7.5 overs to spare .

CRICKET - RUN-OUT GIVES LEWIS AND ENGLAND SLIM SATISFACTION . 
0000305000

LONDON 1996-08-25

Chris Lewis did his best to forget his controversial omission from the England one-day squad on Sunday but could not prevent Pakistan reasserting their dominance in the final test at The Oval . 
340000000000500000000500000000560

A super piece of fielding by Lewis , dropped as a disciplinary measure after arriving only 35 minutes before the start on the fourth morning , provided the only bright spot for England as the touring team batted on to reach 413 for five at the interval , a lead of 87 . 
00000030000000000000000000000000500000000000000000000

The solitary wicket to fall was Asif Mujtaba , run out for 13 attempting a second run to third man where Lewis was lurking with a point to prove . 
000000340000000000000300000000

There seemed scant danger until the Surrey player swooped on to the ball and returned off balance to county team mate Alec Stewart who whipped off the bails . 
00000010000000000000034000000

Lewis , though , could not make similar waves with the ball as Salim Malik and Wasim Akram batted through the rest of the session with few alarms .

SOCCER - CHAMPIONS PORTO KICK OFF SEASON WITH A DRAW . 
00050000000

LISBON 1996-08-25 
50

Portuguese champions Porto kicked off the season with a disappointing 2-2 home draw against Setubal and were lucky to squeeze in an equaliser in extra time . 
701000000000001000000000000

Porto , who are fighting to take their third consecutive title this season , were 2-0 down until the 86th minute when a header by Mario Jardel found the net after a string of missed opportunities , including a penalty taken by top league scorer Domingos Oliveira in the 60th minute . 
1000000000000000000000000340000000000000000003400000

Domingos redeemed himself by netting the equaliser just into extra time . 
300000000000

Setubal , who put on a skilful counter-attack throughout the game , opened the scoring 16 minutes into the match when an unmarked Chiquinho Conde shot around Porto 's new Polish keeper Andrejez Wozniak . 
10000000000000000000000340010070340

Conde scored his second in the 70th minute . 
300000000

Benfica , also playing their first game of the season at home , were held to a 1-1 draw by northern side Braga despite the fact that the visitors were reduced to 10 men in the 54th minute after Rodrigo Carneiro was sent off for a second bookable offence . 
10000000000000000000001000000000000000034000000000

Benfica dominated the game but their lack of a first-class striker was apparent throughout and in the 30th minute they lost key Brazilian midfielder Valdo who suffered a light knee injury . 
10000000000000000000007030000000

He was substituted by Paulao . 
000030

Benfica finally opened the scoring in the 81st minute with a penalty taken by Helder after Luis Baltasar tripped up captain Joao Pinto under the referee 's nose . 
10000000000000303400034000000

Braga defender Idalecio gave his team their equaliser seven minutes from the final whistle with a header into the back of the net .

SOCCER - FIORENTINA WIN WITH BATISTUTA DOUBLE . 
00100300

MILAN 1996-08-25 
50

Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta gave Fiorentina the perfect 70th birthday present on Sunday with two goals that gave the Italian Cup winners a 2-1 Supercup victory over serie A champions Milan . 
70340100000000000007800070078010

The victory , coming on the eve of the founding of the Florence club in 1926 , also marked the first time since the pre-season trophy between the Cup winners and league champions was started in 1988 that the Cup winners had won . 
00000000000050000000000000007000000000070000

Batistuta gave Fiorentina the lead in the 11th minute . 
3010000000

Sweden 's Stefan Schwarz picked him out with a lob to the edge of the box and Batistuta did the rest , chipping veteran defender Franco Baresi and scoring at the near post . 
5034000000000000030000000340000000

Montenegrin midfielder Dejan Savicevic equalised for the home team , weaving past a defender , checking and firing in a left-footed shot in the 21st minute that gave young Fiorentina goalkeeper Francesco Toldo little chance . 
703400000000000000000000000001034000

The scored stayed level to the final minutes but with a penalty shoot out looming , Batistuta took charge . 
00000000000000003000

French international midfielder Marcel Desailly fouled the Argentine , whose coach at Boca Juniors before he joined Fiorentina in 1991 was new Milan coach Oscar Tabarez , and Batistuta rammed home the free kick from 30 metres out . 
700340070000120001000010340030000000000

The 83rd minute shot , curling over the defence and dipping in under the bar from the striker dubbed Batigol by adoring Fiorentina fans , was just reward for Fiorentina who looked a far more impressive team . 
00000000000000000003001000000100000000

Milan 's player of the year George Weah missed a good first half opportunity but otherwise looked a little rusty while Italian team mate Roberto Baggio did not play due to injury . 
100000340000000000000700340000000

New Dutch signing Edgar Davids came on late in the second half as a Milan substitute but made little impact .

Zinzan Brooke , the only No 8 in test rugby to have scored a dropped goal when he kicked a three-pointer against England during last year 's World Cup , added a second to his name yesterday .

I was right here , ' ' he said standing at the spot where he had received the ball for the kick . 
00000000000000000000000

The maul was there and I was going to go in but I thought I should hold off because we had the ball . 
000000000000000000000000

When ( halfback ) Justin Marshall got the ball he was going to go on the openside where Jon Preston was so I emptied my lung at him to get the ball this way . 
00003400000000000034000000000000000

I just hit through and I was punching the air before the ball got there . 
0000000000000000

It cost me a few bucks at the bar . '

The decision to attempt a dropped goal was a spontaneous one , Brooke said .

We were gutted and there was nowhere to hide , they just kept coming at you , ' ' he said .

I was gone in the first 20 minutes , completely exhausted , but you had no choice .

There was just so much riding on it .

Two-try winger Jeff Wilson said he was so tired that he kept asking Bunce where he should be while defending .

South Africa yet to hear from apartheid enforcers .

CAPE TOWN 1996-08-25 
560

South Africa 's truth commission begins issuing subpoenas this week in a bid to dig beneath the political rationales and find the sinister figures who have the blood of the country 's race war on their hands . 
56000000000000000000000000000000000000

Leaders of the major parties involved , from right-wing whites to radical blacks , appeared before Archbishop Desmond Tutu 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission last week to paint the broad picture of their actions for or against apartheid . 
000000000000000003401222000000000000000

Most , including former president F.W. de Klerk and African National Congress Deputy President Thabo Mbeki , offered apologies for any mistakes they had made and accepted broad responsibility for the actions of their foot soldiers . 
0000034401220034000000000000000000000

But none named those guilty of ordering or carrying out any of the gross violations of human rights which Tutu is investigating . 
00000000000000000003000

Human rights lawyer Brian Currin said the hearings last week were not intended as a form of confessional and that those who personally committed crimes during apartheid would testify only before a separate arm of the commission , the amnesty committee . 
000340000000000000000000000000000000000000

" I do n't think one should have expected more than what one got , " he said . " 
00000000000000000000

That was not the amnesty committee where perpetrators are expected to open their hearts and souls and to tell it all . " 
00000000000000000000000

The commission , which has the power to grant amnesty to those who confess to abuses , has begun hearing the testimony from people already in jail for their deeds . 
0000000000000000000000000000000

But others , such as self-confessed secret police hit-squad leader Dirk Coetzee , have yet to testify . 
000000000034000000

Tutu 's deputy chairman , Alex Boraine , told reporters the commission would begin issuing subpoenas to suspects who refused to appear voluntarily some time this week . 
3000034000000000000000000000

He added that former hardline apartheid president P.W. Botha could be among those called . 
000000034000000

But Currin , who is advising several people regarded as perpetrators , said this was not the best way to achieve the commission 's aims . 
03000000000000000000000000

" A person can be forced to appear , but the only way one is going to get to the truth in its totality is if people feel it is a good idea to go to the amnesty committee . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

At the moment this is not the case . " 
0000000000

He cited Coetzee , who was charged with murder after confessing in media interviews to dirty tricks . 
003000000000000000

His trial is due to start in December but the truth commission intends to decide on his amnesty application before that . 
0000000000000000000000

Currin said the law had to be changed so all judicial prosecutions were automatically suspended for those who approached the truth commission . 
30000000000000000000000

Last week 's submissions to the commission by the ANC , de Klerk 's National Party and the right-wing Freedom Front of General Constand Viljoen left many South Africans unsatisfied . 
0000000001034012000120034007800

Boraine said the picture was incomplete because officers of the apartheid-era security forces had yet to make their scheduled , separate submission , but one black caller to a radio talk show declared : 
3000000000000000000000000000000000

" This whole thing is utterly useless , it does n't help us at all . 
0000000000000000

What the people expect is to have houses , to have jobs . " 
00000000000000

Political scientist Jannie Gagiano said he doubted that the National Party , which implemented apartheid in 1948 and began dismantling it in 1990 , felt it carried a burden of guilt and needed to be exculpated through the commission . 
0034000001200000000000000000000000000000

" Therefore I have some doubts about achieving some form of reconciliation . 
0000000000000

One has to feel a bit guilty to feel the need for reconciling yourself to a historical adversary , " he said . 
00000000000000000000000

Professor Tom Lodge of the University of the Witwatersrand demurred , saying : 
0340012220000

" In the irritation , in the jokes , in the anger that white South Africans express about the commission , I think there 's a moral uneasiness , and I think that 's healthy . 
000000000000007800000000000000000000

Responsibility is percolating downwards . "

Moslem refugees seek to vote in Serb-held town .

MATUZICI , Bosnia 1996-08-25 
5050

Thousands of Moslem refugees denounced Bosnia 's elections as a farce on Sunday because Serb incomers would be able to vote in their old home town , cementing partition of the country . 
007005000000007000000000000000000

They said they were ready to force their way back across post-war ethnic lines to Serb-held Doboj , one of several towns where NATO troops fear violence involving refugees determined to vote where they once lived . 
0000000000000007500000010000000000000

The refugees , rallying in Matuzici on government territory two km from Doboj in northeast Bosnia , waved banners calling the polls a farce staged by the United Nations and the European Union . " 
00000500000050050000000000012001200

We demand to vote in Doboj , " other banners said . 
000005000000

Bosnia 's Moslem-led central government and many displaced Moslems are angered by a key provision of the Western-organised September 14 elections allowing people to vote in post-war " new places of residence . " 
5070000070000000070000000000000000

As a result , separatist Serb authorities have packed former Moslem majority towns with refugees of their own or registered other Serbs to vote there . 
00000700007000000000070000

Critics say that what was billed as an electoral process to reintegrate Bosnia as a single , multi-ethnic state is shaping up as a referendum on partition , de facto or de jure . 
0000000000005000000000000000000000

" Only our physical presence in Doboj will mean that the Dayton peace treaty has truly been implemented , " Edhem Efendija Camdzic , Doboj 's Islamic imam-in-exile , told the refugees . 
000000500005000000003440507000000

" The main point of this rally is to highlight to the world powers what misfortune they brought upon us , " said Reuf Mehemdagic , head of Doboj municipality-in-exile . 
0000000000000000000000034000500

" Eleven thousand Serbs who came from elsewhere to Doboj will vote there . 
00070000050000

How can we then expect the reintegration of Bosnia ? 
0000000050

But no one will stop us from returning to our homes . " 
0000000000000

Mirhunisa Komarica , a government refugee official , said : " We want to vote where we were thrown out from . 
3400000000000000000000

This is a protest of warning and the next step is entering our town using all means possible , so let them shoot . " 
0000000000000000000000000

Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic , a Moslem , told the refugees : " We have a message for the Serbs who are now in our homes not to plan the future of their children there because there will be no good fortune in that . " 
70034007000000000000700000000000000000000000000

To loud applause , he added : " We will enter Doboj , untie the Doboj knot and ensure free movement for all . 
000000000005000500000000

We have to enter Doboj to free the Serbs from their own ( separatist ) politics . " 
000050007000000000

The Dayton peace accords guaranteed refugees the right to return to their homes and ensured freedom of movement across ethnic lines . 
0500000000000000000000

But local police , controlled by nationalist parties in Moslem , Serb and Croat sectors of Bosnia , and civilian mobs have turned ceasefire lines into virtually impassable borders . 
000000000707070050000000000000

The majority of refugees from Bosnia 's 1992-95 war are Moslems from the Serb-controlled north and east . 
000005000070070000

NATO-led peace troops beefed up their presence in the Doboj area on Sunday to deter any sudden emotional attempt by the refugees to cross the Inter-Entity Boundary Line into Doboj . 
7000000005000000000000000566050

But the crowd dispersed without incident . 
0000000

Moslems and Serbs have scuffled several times along the line in the past when Moslem refugees tried to surge into the town .

Eight killed in Moscow casino blaze .

MOSCOW 1996-08-25

Eight people died on Sunday in a blaze at a Moscow casino which the fire service said might have been started deliberately , Interfax news agency said . 
0000000000500000000000010000

The number of casinos has soared in Moscow since the collapse of communism . 
00000005000000

The mayor has said he wants to cut their number to five as part of a war against organised crime . 
000000000000000000000

President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree on fighting crime in July and handed wide-ranging powers to security chief Alexander Lebed , currently engaged in making peace in breakaway Chechnya .

Russian troops start pullout , but not in Grozny . 
7000000050

SHATOI , Russia 1996-08-25 
5050

Russian troops began to pull out from southern Chechnya on Sunday under a ceasefire agreement between Russian security chief Alexander Lebed and rebel leaders . 
7000000050000000700340000

But in the capital Grozny , the commander of Russian Interior Ministry forces in Chechnya , General Anatoly Shkirko , told Interfax news agency he was delaying a pullout of troops there after a group of Chechens disarmed an armoured column . 
000050000700005003400100000000000000700000

Reuters cameraman Liutauras Stremaitis said a column of around 40 vehicles , including tanks , armoured personnel carriers , artillery cannons and lorries , escorted by Chechen rebels , pulled out of the village of Shatoi towards the border , around 50 km ( 31 miles ) to the north . 
103400000000000000000000007000000005000000000000000

In Grozny , Shkirko told Interfax he was suspending the pullout of troops from the capital until weapons seized by the Chechens were returned . 
0503010000000000000007000

Chechen rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov confirmed the weapons had been seized but that it was a maverick group of Chechens . 
700340000000000000070

He said later that the rebels had handed them over . 
00000000000

The pullout of the Russian troops is a key element of the peace plan brokered by Lebed , which aims to end the 20-month Chechnya conflict .

Leftist Mexican armed group says troops in capital . 
070000000

MEXICO CITY 1996-08-25 
560

The leftist Popular Revolutionary Army ( EPR ) in a published report on Sunday said it operated throughout Mexico , including the capital , and denied government assertions it was isolated to one state . 
00122010000000000050000000000000000

Commanders " Vicente " and " Oscar " , guarded by a dozen EPR gunmen , said in an interview with La Jornada outside Mexico City that the armed group was committed to overthrowing the government . 
0030003000000100000001205600000000000

" They ( government officials ) want to present us before public opinion as a local problem , as just being from Guerrero and as irrational radicals , " Commander Oscar told La Jornada . 
00000000000000000000005000000030120

They said the ERP , whose fighters first appeared wearing military fatigues and brandishing assault rifles in the southwestern state of Guerrero on June 28 , had a 23,000-strong membership , but this could not be confirmed independently . 
000100000000000000000500000000000000000

La Jornada also reported on Sunday that the Mexican Army has discovered a 37-page , EPR manual detailing guerrilla tactics and strategies . 
12000000120000010000000

It quoted the manual as saying : " The objective of the Basic Course on War is to provide for combatants of the EPR basic military knowledge for the armed conflict against the police and military apparatus of the bourgeoisie . " 
000000000000000000000001000000000000000000

It was the second time armed " commanders " of the EPR have granted interviews outside Guerrero state , an extremely poor and volatile region where leftist protesters often have clashed violently with authorities . 
00000000000100005000000000000000000

Unlike the better known and unrelated Zapatista rebels in southeastern Chiapas state , the EPR has never taken on the army in direct combat , according to official reports . 
000000100050001000000000000000

There have only been a few skirmishes in Guerrero in which a handful of police , soldiers and civilians have been killed or injured .

Ten people gunned down in northwest Colombia .

BOGOTA , Colombia 1996-08-25

Unidentified gunmen dragged 10 men out ot their homes in a rural area of Colombia 's northwest province of Antioquia and shot them to death , authorities said on Sunday . 
0000000000000050000500000000000

Police said the killings occurred on Saturday morning in the municipality of Anza but news of the massacre only reached the provincial capital of Medellin early on Sunday . 
00000000000050000000000050000

Anza is only 20 miles ( 30 km ) west of Medellin , but there are no roads linking it directly to the city . 
5000000000050000000000000

Police initially said leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) rebels were prime suspects in the killings . 
00001222201000000000

But gunmen of the left and right have killed with impunity across Antioquia for years , and there were unconfirmed reports that the latest bloodshed was the work of a right-wing paramilitary group .

Two Thai border police wounded by Burma gunmen .

MAE SOT , Thailand 1996-08-25

Two Thai border policemen were seriously wounded on Sunday when members of a Burmese rebel splinter faction ambushed their patrol in northwest Thailand , security officers said . 
0700000000000700000000500000

The two were wounded in the early hours of Sunday when some 30 members of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army ( DKBA ) ambushed their patrol on the Thai side of the border with Burma , to the north of the town of Mae Sot . 
0000000000000000122201000000700000500000000560

The Thai army commander in the area , Col Suvit Maenmuan , told reporters the DKBA , which is allied with the Rangoon military government and based in southeast Burma , had recently stepped up cross-border infiltration .

Egypt hopes jars will reveal secrets of mummies .

Archaeologists in Egypt have found pots used by ancient Egyptians in burial rites that they say may reveal the secrets of mummification . 
00500000070000000000000

Mohammed Saleh , director of the Egyptian Museum , told Reuters television a U.S. team found the pots , some of which contain human intestines , in a tomb built into the rocks while digging in Dahshour , a village 40 km ( 25 miles ) south of Cairo . 
34000070001005000000000000000000000050000000000050

Dahshour is the site of Egypt 's second largest pyramid , built for the pharaoh Seneferu more than 4,500 years ago . 
5000050000000003000000

Saleh said the team -- from New York 's Metropolitan Museum -- found four Canopic jars and two unguent jars in the tomb , which belongs to an unidentifed person who lived during the 12th Dynasty ( 1991-1786 BC ) in the Middle Kingdom . 
300000560560007000000000000000000078007000560

" This finding is important because one of the jars still contains substances and materials used in the conservation of mummies and the conservation of the intestines and all the things which were in the cavity of a person we have not identified yet , " Saleh said . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000300

" We hope that the analysis of such substances and liquids will reveal some secrets of the mummification process and materials used in this process , " he added .

Israeli President Ezer Weizman , weighing a possible meeting with Yasser Arafat , consulted on Sunday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , a spokesman said . 
70340000003400000003400000

Weizman and Netanyahu met at the president 's official Jerusalem residence and planned to speak to the media at the end of their talks , the prime minister 's spokesman said . 
30300000050000000000000000000000

Earlier , the director of the president 's office denied a report in Israel 's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that Weizman had already invited Arafat to his private home for talks in the coming week on the future of the Israel-PLO peace process . 
0000000000000501200300030000000000000007000

But the official , Aryeh Shumer , said it was only fitting that Weizman and Arafat should talk after the Palestinian leader sent the Israeli president a letter which Yedioth Ahronoth reported contained an emotional appeal to save the peace proces . 
000034000000030300007000700001200000000000

The newspaper said Netanyahu , who is cool to meeting Arafat himself , opposed talks between Weizman and the Palestinian president . 
0003000000300000300700

After Moslem suicide bombers killed 59 people in Israel in February and March , Weizman called for peace efforts with the PLO to be suspended .

Shumer said his current position was that the peace process must continue .

Israeli president invites Arafat to home - paper .

Israeli President Ezer Weizman has invited Yasser Arafat to meet him at his private home , Israel 's biggest newspaper said on Sunday . 
703400340000000050000000

The Yedioth Ahronoth daily reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who has said he has no desire to hold talks with the Palestinian president , opposes the meeting due to be held this coming week . 
0120000034000000000000070000000000000

The newspaper said Weizman scheduled the meeting at his private residence in the central Israeli village of Caesarea after Arafat sent him an emotional appeal " to save the peace process " . 
000300000000007005030000000000000

Netanyahu met Weizman last Tuesday and voiced his opposition , Yedioth said . 
3030000000100

" I am prepared to postpone the meeting under one condition -- that you give me a commitment right now to meet Arafat yourself within 10 days , " the paper quoted Weizman as telling Netanyahu .

The office of Israeli president is largely ceremonial .

Corporate America taking new view on compensation . 
05000000

Anne Murray

NEW YORK 1996-08-23 
560

Corporate America is planning major changes in employee compensation in the next few years , according to a recent study . 
050000000000000000000

What it comes down to is this : If you 're highly skilled , you 'll benefit nicely . 
0000000000000000000

But if you 're not and cannot contribute to your employer 's goals , you 'll be paid less . 
00000000000000000000

The survey , conducted in late 1995 and the early part of this year by management consulting firm Towers Perrin , showed that the focus will be on an employee 's overall value to the company 's bottom line -- rather than how well an employee performs a specific task . 
000000000000000000120000000000000000000000000000000

Presently , for example , if an accountant 's job involves doing five specific tasks , he or she can expect a certain salary , said Sandra O'Neal , a Towers Perrin principal . 
0000000000000000000000000034001200

In the future , the accountant will be evaluated solely on " knowledge , skill and abilities , " she said . 
0000000000000000000000

In addition to using accounting skills , the accountant will also have to be creative , work well in a team , be sensitive to customer needs and set productivity goals . 
00000000000000000000000000000000

" The good news is , if you 're highly skilled and have many abilities , you 'll be paid more , " said O'Neal . 
00000000000000000000000030

" The bad news is , if you 're not skilled and ca n't contribute to a team , to customer service and the organisation 's goals , you 'll be paid less . " 
00000000000000000000000000000000000

Of the 750 mid-to-large size corporations surveyed , 81 percent had undergone a major restructuring in the last three years , and more than two-thirds reported that productivity and profits were up as result . 
00000000000000000000000000000000000

Next on the agenda for these firms is developing a new compensation structure , and 78 percent report that they are considering a new , skills-based plan for both management and non-management employees . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000

This coming shift , O'Neal said , " is not just isolated or a fad . 
0000300000000000

It 's an inexorable change . " 
0000000

After World War II , corporations adopted a " military model " creating hierarchical organisations where " the concept of defined tasks worked great , " she said . 
07880000000000000000000000000

But as the economy became global , customers were more demanding and problems became more complex . 
00000000000000000

" Multi-layers kept management at a distance from its customers , " O'Neal said . 
000000000000300

Now organisations must change to stay competitive . 
00000000

O'Neal says firms will place a greater emphasis on teams and team performance in giving raises . 
30000000000000000

If your team does well , you 'll do well . 
00000000000

If it does n't do well , do n't expect a raise . 
0000000000000

Is this fair to an employee who can go the distance but is on a team that ca n't keep up ? 
0000000000000000000000

" That 's an important question we used to ask a lot , " said O'Neal . " 
000000000000000300

It 's not a question we ask any more . 
0000000000

The more important question is -- ' Do we have results ? ' 
0000000000000

" 
0

To get those results , 27 percent of the companies surveyed plan to eliminate base pay increases in favour of cash bonuses and incentives , such as employee and team award programmes and education . 
00000000000000000000000000000000000

Companies that can change their culture and view employees as business partners will do well , O'Neal said . 
0000000000000000300

For example , the survey rated some participants in the survey as " high-performing " companies , based on their return on equity above 16 percent . 
000000000000000000000000000

Those companies also said they already offer employees variable pay and business education , give their managers more control over pay decisions and celebrate employee and team success . 
00000000000000000000000000000

" They respect employees more , they trust employees more and they value their employees more , " O'Neal said . 
000000000000000000300

" The key to success at high-performance companies is engaging employees in a business partnership . 
0000000000000000

It will improve a company 's bottom line . "

Investigators arrested a senior police detective on Sunday in connection with their inquiries into Belgium 's child sex scandal , Public Prosecutor Michel Bourlet said . 
00000000000000500000003400

" Georges Zicot was arrested and will be charged with truck theft , insurance fraud and document forgery , " Bourlet told a news conference . 
03400000000000000000300000

He said there had been searches at three sites on Sunday , including one at the Charleroi judicial police headquarters where Zicot worked . 
000000000000000050000300

Zicot , 45 , is a specialist in tackling vehicle theft . 
300000000000

Belgian media reported that he had been questioned twice in the past two years about thefts but released both times . 
700000000000000000000

He was promoted to chief detective earlier this year . 
0000000000

Bourlet said two other people had also been arrested . 
3000000000

One was Gerard Pignon , the owner of a warehouse where stolen vehicles were allegedly stored . 
00340000000000000

The other was insurer Thierry Dehaan . 
0000340

Bourlet said the investigation into the vehicle theft ring would be added to the inquiry into the paedophile sex scandal in which five other people have already been arrested . 
300000000000000000000000000000

He said the connection was through Bernard Weinstein , an accomplice of convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux -- the central figure in the paedophile scandal that has sent shockwaves across Europe . 
00000034000000034000000000000050

Weinstein was found dead last weekend alongside the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in a house belonging to Detroux , who said they starved to death earlier this year , nine months after being abducted in June 1995 . 
300000000003403400000300000000000000000000

Two other girls have been rescued and police are hunting for at least two more who Dutroux has admitted kidnapping a year ago . 
000000000000000030000000

" Dutroux has admitted killing Weinstein after a disagreement between the accomplices in an affair of truck theft , " Bourlet said . 
03000300000000000000300

Another four people were also questioned at the weekend but had not been detained , Bourlet added . 
000000000000000300

Anne Thily , public prosecutor in the eastern city of Liege where Julie and Melissa lived , said this was a major case involving some 50 investigators -- including two from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation .

A bus fell from a mountain road into a river in Pakistan-ruled Azad ( free ) Kashmir on Sunday , killing at least 19 people and injuring 11 , police said .

North Afghan highway opening put off , radio says .

ISLAMABAD 1996-08-25

The planned reopening of Afghanistan 's main northern Salang highway as a result of peace talks with an opposition alliance has been put off until Wednesday , official Kabul Radio said on Sunday . 
0000500050000000000000000000120000

The embattled Afghan government said last week that the Kabul-Salang highway would be opened on Monday or Tuesday following talks with the Supreme Coordination Council alliance led by Jumbish-i-Milli movement of powerful opposition warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum . 
007000000500000000000012220010000003440

The radio said on Sunday the postponement of the opening had been made due to " precautions " . 
0000000000000000000

It did not elaborate . 
00000

The Salang highway , Afghanistan 's main route to Central Asia , has been controlled by Dostum since he began fighting President Burhanuddin Rabbani 's government in Kabul in January 1994 in alliance with Hezb-i-Islami party leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , then prime minister but rival to the president . 
0500500005600000300000340005000000100340000000000

Hekmatyar rejoined the government as prime minister last June under a peace pact with Rabbani and has since been trying to persuade other opposition factions to follow suit . 
30000000000000300000000000000

Earlier this month , Jumbish denied a Kabul government statement that the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire in the north .

Students backed by opposition parties battled police and burned an effigy of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during a strike in the north Bangladeshi town of Bogra on Sunday . 
00000000000000030000007005000

The strikers barricaded streets , attacked the local office of the ruling Awami League , fought running battles with police and set alight hundreds of copies of the popular " Janakantha " newspaper , alleging it was pro-government . 
000000000000120000000000000000100000000

Police used batons and teargas to try to disperse students who were throwing stones and home-made bombs , witnesses said . 
000000000000000000000

The strike , called by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ) , to denounce the deaths of four students killed by police over the last few days , coincided with a visit to the area by Hasina . 
00000000122010000000000000000000000000030

Local officials said one policeman was killed by gunshots during clashes with pro-opposition students on Thursday . 
00000000000000000

Hasina told a cross section of people at the Bogra police headquarters on Sunday that the government had already suspended three police officers and ordered a judicial probe into the violent incidents . 
300000000500000000000000000000000

The prime minister offered financial grants to the families of those killed , ordered the best possible medical care for the injured and urged Bogra residents to call off the strike .

Police stormed ten residence halls on the campus , flushed out people at gunpoint and searched their baggage .

They seized revolvers , sawn-off rifles , shotguns and knives . 
00000000000

The students were later allowed to return .

BATKIVSHCHYNA COLLECTIVE FARM , Ukraine 1996-08-26

Four shiny new green-and-yellow John Deere combines parked at this 1,750-hectare ( 4,325-acre ) farm in the grain-growing regions south of Kiev do n't fill its chief agronomist with enthusiasm . 
0000340000000000000005000000000

" They did a good job this year , but they need good diesel and good engine oil , " said Ivan Odnosum . " 
0000000000000000000003400

God help us if there is a breakdown , " he said of the machinery , loaned to the farm after the Ukrainian government bought it earlier this year . 
300000000000000000000070000000

The country 's grain harvest this year is forecast to fall by more than 23 percent to only 28 million tonnes and two harsh factors are to blame . 
00000000000000000000000000000

A drought scoured the steppes in May and June , stunting the growing wheat . 
000000000000000

And the farming sector , making the painful transition from Soviet central planning to a market economy simply has no money . 
0000000000700000000000

Ukraine 's black soil is so fertile that a diplomat described it as " rich enough to grow rubber boots " . 
5000000000000000000000

But recently Ukraine has been losing its reputation as a breadbasket of Europe , earned in the years before brutal forced collectivisation under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin . 
0050000000005000000000070340

" The wheat will not be of a good quality this year , " said Hryhory Borsuk , a scientist at the Mironivka Wheat Institute , run by the Ukrainian Academy of Agrarian Sciences . 
00000000000000034000001220000122220

" The temperature on the ground reached 62 decrees Celsius ( 143.60 Fahrenheit ) this summer . 
00000000070000000

We 've never seen anything so bad , " he said in an interview in his office , unlit since the government cut off electricity because of unpaid power bills . 
0000000000000000000000000000000

The harvest is gathered in the dry areas , but rainfall in Western Ukraine has delayed harvesting there . 
0000000000005600000

While Mironivka 's scientists , some unpaid for months , carry on developing new strains of wheat resistant to Ukraine 's extreme continental climate , Borsuk said the lack of cash in Ukraine 's agricultural sector is as bad as the drought . 
0100000000000000000500000300000050000000000

Collective farms and Ukraine 's nascent private farming sector have no money for fertiliser , no money for herbicides and pesticides , no money to repair old or buy new machinery , no money for fuel , and none to buy good seed . 
00050000000000000000000000000000000000000000

This year 's harvest is down from last year 's 36.5 million tonne harvest , which in turn compares with 50 million tonnes in 1990 , the year before independence . 
0000000000000000000000000000000

The decline is all the worse for people who recall wasteful Soviet times , when the Kremlin imported grain but priced bread so cheaply that people bought it to feed their pigs . 
000000000007000050000000000000000

" Agriculture is very expensive , and there are no solutions to our problems on the horizon , " said Odnosum . 
0000000000000000000030

He said his farm , its 260 workers now readying the fields for winter wheat sowing , expected the land to yield 5.2 tonnes per hectare ( 2.5 acres ) but ended up with 3.9 tonnes -- still better than the national average of 2.11 tonnes per hectare this year . 
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

" We did not have money for fertiliser , we 're in debt for fuel , and we 're borrowing diesel , " Odnosum said . 
00000000000000000000000300

A few kilometres ( miles ) down the two-lane road which passes Odnosum 's farm , where the occasional horse-drawn buggy passes by , is the 1,700-hectare ( 4,200-acre ) Shevchenko collective farm , built next to a village still neat and tidy despite post-Soviet decay . 
00000000000030000000000000000030000000000000700

Chief Accountant Natalya Sypron said the collective is strapped for cash , earlier this year bartering 220 tonnes of grain for diesel to fuel six rickety grain combines and tractors badly in need of repairs and basic maintenance . 
003400000000000000000000000000000000000

The average family earns 160-200 million karbovanets a year ( $ 800 - $ 1,000 ) -- but many have not been paid in months , Soprun said . " 
000000000000000000000000003000

People are working out of their own dedication . " 
0000000000

Borsuk said the farm sector has two options : " We can sit down and cry , or we can do something . " 
300000000000000000000000

He said the government plans to increase the sowing of the winter wheat which will be harvested next year . 
00000000000000000000

Planted in late summer and early autumn , the grain is Ukraine 's largest export item and traditionally grows better than summer wheat in Ukraine 's soil . 
0000000000050000000000005000

Further plans , he said , called for full provision of resources like fertiliser and herbicides for 25 percent of Ukraine 's arable land next year , for 50 percent in 1998 and 100 percent of the land in 1999 . 
00000000000000000000500000000000000000000

" If we follow this we 'll be able to sell 10 million tonnes of grain by the year 2000 , " Borkus said . 
0000000000000000000000300

The government has been trying to phase out huge subsidies to the farm sector , and in a move back to pre-Soviet days has given up to 50 hectares ( 124 acres ) of land to some 36,000 private farmers willing to go it alone . 
0000000000000000000007000000000000000000000000

Collective farms will last for the next few years , because most private farms now only produce enough to feed themselves with maybe a little extra to sell , said one private farmer : " In the future , maybe , but it 's better not to hurry . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

" Collectivisation brought us a lot of pain . 
000000000

And it went too fast . 
000000

Privatising too quickly can also have a negative outcome . "

Gencor swells profit despite setbacks .

JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-26

Gencor Ltd on Monday said it had swelled its year attributable profit and streamlined operations to strengthen it for the current financial year despite a variety of divisional setbacks . 
120000000000000000000000000000

Announcing the group 's results for the year ended June 30 , chairman Brian Gilbertson said : " Happily the strong improvement in financial performance is not an illusion arising from the recent weakness of the rand relative to the dollar . " 
0000000000000340000000000000000000000000000

Gencor raised attributable earnings to 1,803 million rand from 1,003 million rand previously - in dollar terms an increase to $ 469 million from $ 279 million - and won despite the group 's Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd posting dismal results . 
100000000000000000000000000000000012220000

" Not everything has gone well . 
0000000

We 've had substantial production difficulties at a number of our operations . 
0000000000000

The most obvious one with the greatest effect on the corporation was at Impala where we had the furnace failure , " Gilbertson said . 
0000000000000100000000300

Implats posted year attributable profit of 176 million rand from 281 million previously . 
10000000000000

Not only did the company lock in 3.92 rand per dollar in February / March , but it suffered output losses due to a furnace shutdown last August . 
00000000000000000000000000000

The rand was last bid at 4.5350 against the dollar . 
00000000000

Nor was Implats the only operation to fail output targets . 
00100000000

Ingwe Coal Corporation Ltd was hit hard by heavy rains . 
12220000000

It forfeited nearly one million tonnes of production to flooding at its mines in Mpumulanga province . 
00000000000000500

But Gilbertson said the greatest gloom in the year came from the European Commission 's blocking of Implats ' proposed merger with Lonrho Plc 's platinum interests . 
0300000000001200010000120000

" The big disappointment for the year was the failure of the platinum merger . 
000000000000000

From Gencor 's perspective we are taking the position that it is not on , " Gilbertson said . 
0100000000000000300

Looking ahead to the current financial year , he said that Gencor would boost earnings further . 
00000000000100000

" Gencor is well placed to take up the challenges of the future . 
01000000000000

The group is soundly structured and prudently financed and is blessed with an excellent portfolio of world-class businesses . 
0000000000000000000

I think we can look forward to further growth " . 
00000000000

Citing the disposal of Gencor 's stake in industrial holdings group Malbak Ltd for one billion rand among other smaller disposals , Gilbertson said Gencor had pruned its portfolio to concentrate on core assets . 
00001000000120000000003010000000000

" We 've tried to clean up our overall portfolio by disposing of non-core assets . 
0000000000000000

The biggest of those was Malbak . 
0000010

Overall a very substantial pruning ... 
000000

leaving Gencor clearly structured along commodity lines , " Gilbertson said . 
010000000300

He added that the group still had about 85 million rand after tax invested in various shares , which were market for disposal when required . 
00000000000000000000000000

Referring to Gencor 's increased 41.5 percent stake in Ingwe , Gilbertson said the group would wait for coal shares to be cheaper before considering snapping up more . 
00100000010300000000000000000

" I think we would have liked to have more of Ingwe but it 's the question of adding value . 
000000000001000000000

When we bought the shares we bought ... 
00000000

at quite a bit lower than the price is now ... 
00000000000

maybe if we just wait another few years for the next downturn in coal . " 
0000000000000000

Finally , Gilbertson said a growing proportion of Gencor 's income was coming from offshore and unlisted investments .

unit , for about $ 400 million in cash , creating one of the world 's largest makers of intravenous infusion therapy products . 
000000000000000000000000

Under the agreement , IVAC and Advanced Medical 's wholly owned subsidiary , IMED Corp. , will merge to form a new company that will develop and manufacture infusion pumps that regulate the amount of intravenous fluid being administered to a patient , as well as proprietary disposable products . 
00001012000001200000000000000000000000000000000000

The combined company will have estimated revenues of $ 353 million . 
000000000000

Advanced Medical , through IMED , is already one of the nation 's largest developers and manufacturers of intravenous infusion pumps and proprietary disposable products . 
12001000000000000000000000

It has sales in 38 foreign countries . 
00000000

San Diego-based IVAC is a major provider of infusion systems and related technologies to the health-care industry . 
781000000000000000

It has manufacturing plants in San Diego ; Creedmoor , N.C. ; Hampshire , England ; and Tijuana , Mexico , and distributes its prodcuts in more than 120 countries .

Eli Lilly sold IVAC on Dec. 31 , 1994 to DLJ Merchant Banking Partners LP , River Medical Inc. and other investors . 
12010000001222201220000

Advanced Medical said it expects to take an unspecified one-time charge to pay for the merger . 
12000000000000000

It did not say when the charge would be taken . 
00000000000

" The addition of IVAC is expected to contribute to financial results in the full second quarter of 1997 , " the companies said . 
0000100000000000000000000

The merger will add to both companies ' historical leadership in infusion therapy and technology-based drug delivery devices , they said . 
0000000000000000000000

In 1968 , IVAC introduced the world 's first infusion therapy monitoring device . 
00010000000000

A year later IVAC improved its system with the addition of an IV pump that regulated the flow of liquids through positive pressure . 
000100000000000000000000

IMED introduced the world 's first volumetric infusion pump in 1974 . 
100000000000

IMED had profits of $ 1.7 million , or 6 cents per fully diluted common share , on $ 53.9 million in revenues in the first half of 1996 . 
100000000000000000000000000000

Excluding the effect of a one-time restructuring charge of $ 17.4 million , IVAC had net income of $ 4.2 million on net sales of $ 112.8 million for the 1996 first half . 
0000000000000100000000000000000000

Advanced Medical reported profits of $ 8.4 million on sales of $ 29.2 million in the quarter ended June 30 .

SOCCER - SHARPE HITS WINNER TO EASE PRESSURE ON LEEDS . 
00300000010

LEEDS , England 1996-08-26 
5050

Winger Lee Sharpe hit a superb strike from the edge of the penalty area to give Leeds their first win of the season on Monday and leave hapless Wimbledon anchored at the bottom of the England premier league . 
034000000000000010000000000010000005000

Sharpe repaid a huge slice of the 4.5 million pound ( $ 6.98 million ) fee Leeds handed Manchester United for his services with a top-draw second-half goal to hand Wimbledon their third successive defeat .

Ian Rush , the Welsh striker signed from Liverpool in the close season , set up the goal , feeding Sharpe as he galloped forward and the former England winger cut inside onto his unfavoured right foot to arc a shot into the right-hand corner of the net .

The tiny islands of the Seychelles failed to make soccer history at the weekend when they bowed out of the preliminary rounds of the African Nations Cup . 
0000050000000000000000007880

Trailing fellow Indian Ocean islanders Mauritius 1-0 from the first leg , they were held to a 1-1 draw at home on Saturday despite playing against 10 men for most of the match . 
0056050000000000000000000000000000

The 2-1 aggregate took Mauritius into the group phase of the qualifiers for the 1998 finals , and kept up the Seychelles ' record of never having won an official match in their 10 years of FIFA membership . 
000050000000000000000500000000000000100

The Seychelles must have thought they were on course for a historic breakthrough when Mauritian midfielder Andre Caboche was sent off for a crude tackle in the 19th minute . 
050000000000007034000000000000

But the visitors responded to the setback immediately -- veteran striker Ashley Mocude scoring a minute later to give them a two-goal aggregate lead . 
0000000000034000000000000

Although Danny Rose 's 50th-minute equaliser gave the Seychellois renewed hope they could not find the net again and were eliminated . 
0340000070000000000000

Mauritius now play in group seven of the qualifiers against Malawi , Mozambique and favourites Zambia . 
50000000005050050

Namibia , who drew 0-0 with Botswana in their first leg , won the second leg in Windhoek 6-0 to stretch their unbeaten run to eight matches and continue their remarkable progress on the African soccer stage . 
50000050000000000500000000000000007000

They now play in group five with Cameroon , Gabon and Kenya . 
0000000505050

German-based striker Bachirou Salou returned home to Togo to score the decisive only goal of their tie against Congo . 
00340005000000000050

Salou , who plays for MSV Duisburg in the Bundesliga , scored in the 53rd minute of Sunday 's match in Lome for a 1-0 aggregate win which takes his side into group six , where they will meet Liberia , Tanzania and Zaire . 
300001200700000000000500000000000000000505050

Ethiopia needed a penalty shoot-out in Addis Ababa to overcome Uganda after a 2-2 aggregate scoreline . 
50000056005000000

Both legs ended 1-1 before Ethiopia won the spot kick decider 4-2 . 
0000050000000

Uganda 's elimination follows their humiliating 5-1 aggregate defeat by Angola in June 's World Cup qualifying preliminaries .

0030000000

MOSCOW 1996-08-26 
50

Russian double Olympic swimming champion Alexander Popov was in a serious condition on Monday after being stabbed on a Moscow street . 
7070034000000000000500

A doctor said it was too early to say whether Popov , the only man to retain the Olympic 50 and 100 metres freestyle titles , would return to top-level sport . 
00000000003000000070000000000000

" His condition is serious , " said Rimma Maslova , deputy chief doctor of Hospital No 31 in the Russian capital . " 
000000003400000566007000

But he is conscious and is talking and smiling . " 
00000000000

Maslova told Reuters she was not an expert in sports medicine , but said it was too early to judge Popov 's chances of returning to competitive swimming . 
30100000000000000000300000000

Popov , who won gold in the 50 and 100 metres freestyle at the recent Atlanta Olympics , was stabbed in the abdomen late on Saturday after an argument with a group of roadside watermelon sellers in south-west Moscow . 
3000000000000007800000000000000000000050

Maslova said the wound had affected a lung and a kidney . 
300000000000

Doctors operated on Popov , 24 , for three hours . 
00030000000

Popov told NTV television on Sunday he was in no danger and promised he would be back in the pool shortly . " 
30100000000000000000000

There 's no need to worry . 
0000000

We 're going to be walking soon -- and swimming , " he insisted cheerfully from his bed in the intensive care unit . 
000000000000000000000000

Interfax news agency said police had detained one of the attackers . 
100000000000

It said the row started when Popov and a group of his friends were returning from a party . 
0000003000000000000

Vitaly Smirnov , president of the Russian National Olympic Committee , said President Boris Yeltsin had given the swimmer Russia 's top award for his Olympic performance . " 
34000078880003400005000007000

I am not a doctor but I think he is doing all right , " said Smirnov . 
000000000000000030

Smirnov said the Olympic Committee might ask the government to take measures to protect the country 's best athletes , some of whom have already chosen to live abroad for fear of a surge in crime in post-Soviet Russia .

Two key players left a Brazilian championship match early on Sunday because they had to catch a plane to Russia to play with the national team . 
000007000000000000050000000

Sao Paulo midfielder Andre and Santos defender Narciso were both substituted during their teams ' game , taken to Sao Paulo airport and flown to Rio de Janeiro in a private jet chartered by the Brazilian Football Confederation ( CBF ) . 
120301030000000000056000056600000007880700

At Rio , they joined up with the national team squad for the journey to Moscow , where Brazil will face Russia in a friendly international on Wednesday . 
05000000000000050050050000000

The problem arose because the Sao Paulo-Santos clash was selected as the day 's televised live match , forcing it to be put back three hours from the usual kickoff time . 
00000120000000000000000000000000

Santos suffered more from their loss as Narciso 's replacement Jean gave away a penalty from which Sao Paulo scored the decisive goal in a 2-1 win . 
1000000300300000012000000000

Sao Paulo lead the first stage of the championship on goal difference from surprise package Juventude , who beat Internacional 2-1 . 
1200000000000001000100

Corinthians , who played in a tournament in Spain last week , also faced a plane marathon as they attempted to keep up with a hectic fixture list . 
10000000500000000000000000000

They were due to leave Spain Monday night , arrive in Sao Paulo on Tuesday morning , catch another plane to the southern city of Curitiba one hour later and then play away to Atletico Paranaense in the Brazilian championship the same evening . 
00000500000560000000000005000000001200700000

Botafogo striker Tulio , who was overlooked by Zagalo for the tour which also features a game away to the Netherlands on Sunday , scored his third goal in three games as the defending champions beat Bahia 2-1 away . 
1030000030000000000050000000000000001000

Tulio , who has been top-scorer in the competition for the last two seasons , has been struggling against injury for most of this year .

TENNIS - QUENCH YOUR THIRST - IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT AT U.S. OPEN .

A message on television monitors all around the National Tennis Centre reads : " Due to hot weather please seek shade and drink plenty of fluids " -- sound advice until you check out the price of fluids . 
000000005660000000000000000000000000000

Perhaps the advisory was cut off before concluding : " ...and bring plenty of money . " 
00000000000000000

A small bottle of a garishly-coloured sports drink at the sun-drenched U.S. Open is going for $ 3.75 , while a litre of basic , life-sustaining water will set you back $ 4.00 -- for water ? 
0000000000078000000000000000000000000

" At the Olympics water was only a dollar , and that was the Olympics , " said one incredulous fan , noting that the Atlanta Games had been notorious for price gouging . 
0007000000000070000000000780000000

U.S. Open officials managed to insult most of the male tennis players last week with their controversial handling of the seeding and draw . 
780000000000000000000000

When the tournament began on Monday it was the fans ' turn to be offended . 
0000000000000000

" That baked lasagna better be good for $ 8.50 , " said New Yorker Rebecca Weinstein , a U.S. Open regular who was eating a sandwich she had brought from home . 
000000000000078340078000000000000

A trio of hungry fans at the food court who had already forked over the lasagna money pronounced it good , but Carol Perry chimed in , " The water is ridiculous , they want four dollars for the water , you might as well get a glass of wine . " 
0000000000000000000000340000000000000000000000000000

Indeed , a nice glass of chardonnay or white zinfandel was going for $ 4.75 , while an imported beer was just a bit more than the water at $ 4.50 . 
00000000000000000000000000000000

What 's the message here ? " 
0000000

Maybe they want us to be alcoholics , " Perry joked before lifting her glass of wine . 
000000000300000000

Fans will be shelling out $ 12.50 for a hamburger and a large french fries . 
0000000000000000

And that little snack is guaranteed to make you thirsty . 
00000000000

Make that $ 16.50 . 
00000

Even a sandwich as pedestrian as a ham and swiss cheese is going for a whopping $ 8.00 . 
0000000000000000000

Of course , it is served on a tuscan roll . 
00000000000

It must be the cost of flying those rolls over from Tuscany every day that drives up the price of the sandwich .

TENNIS - HUBER AND MALEEVA FALL , UP-AND-COMERS ADVANCE AT OPEN .

Martina Hingis led a youthful charge and Australian Open finalist Anke Huber and Magdalena Maleeva were fallen seeds on Monday in a hot , sunny opening to the U.S. Open tennis championships . 
340000078034034000000000000078000

The 15-year-old Hingis , seeded 16th , was honoured to play the first match of the season 's last Grand Slam on Stadium Court but happy to hurry off with a straight-sets victory over the 112th-ranked Angeles Montolio of Spain . 
00300000000000000007805600000000000034050

" It was very hot and I did n't want to stay long on the court , " said a cheery Hingis , who had no worries in racing to a 6-1 6-0 victory against the overmatched Spaniard . 
000000000000000000000300000000000000070

Hoping for a longer engagement on the cement at Flushing Meadows were the sixth-seeded Huber of Germany and 12th seed Maleeva of Bulgaria . 
000000000560003050003050

Huber , who lost to Monica Seles in the Australian Open final , fell victim to an unfortunate draw in bowing to dangerous floater Amanda Coetzer of South Africa . 
300003400780000000000000340560

Coetzer , ranked 17th , avenged her defeat to Huber in the Australian Open semifinals by winning 6-1 2-6 6-2 . 
300000000300780000000

" I looked at it as not a first round match , just a great challenge for me , " said Coetzer , 24 . " 
00000000000000000000030000

I was really concentrating on keeping my own momentum and my own rhythm . 
00000000000000

" She is tough to play in that way because she plays very up and down . 
00000000000000000

She played one great game and than a few errors . 
00000000000

The challenge was just for me to keep playing my own game . " 
00000000000000

Huber , who reached the final a week ago at Manhattan Beach , could only mourn her luck of the draw . 
3000000000560000000000

" I was n't happy when I saw the draw . 
00000000000

She was the first non- seeded player , " said the 21-year-old German . " 
000000000000700

It 's always tough to play somebody like that in the first round in a Grand Slam . 
000000000000000780

" I think I did n't play that bad today . 
00000000000

It was maybe my best first round match in a Grand Slam I ever played . " 
00000000007800000

Monday brought the best out in U.S. Open rookie Aleksandra Olsza of Poland , ranked 110th . 
00000078034050000

The 18-year-old Olsza , last year 's Wimbledon junior champion , celebrated her debut in the main draw of the Open by removing Maleeva 6-4 6-2 . 
003000070000000000007003000

The curtain-raising victories by Hingis and Olsza provided a ringing endorsement for the newest wave of women 's players coming up from the junior ranks . 
00003030000000000000000000

The Swiss teenager , a twice French Open junior champion and a Wimbledon juniors winner , had already proven her main stage mettle by reaching the quarters at this year 's Australian Open . 
0700007800007000000000000000000780

" I hope I can get into the last 16 , " said Hingis , seeded to face third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the fourth round . 
0000000000000300000034400000

Hingis has been working hard on conditioning and has lost eight pounds ( 3.5 kilos ) in advance of the championships . 
3000000000000000000000

" There will be tough matches but I hope I can get there , " she said . " 
0000000000000000000

Then we 'll see if Arantxa will be there , too . " 
0000030000000

The fast-moving Olsza , 18 , was cool in her opening match . 
0030000000000

" I was n't scared when I heard that I was playing Maleeva , " said Olsza . " 
0000000000003000300

I know that if I want to play professional tennis I have to do my best to try to beat her and I ca n't be scared . " 
00000000000000000000000000000

Olsza is undaunted by the level of competition in the pros . 
300000000000

" In terms of tennis , I think the junior players are really good now . 
0000000000000000

In a few years , it could change a lot among the top players . " 
0000000000000000

Two big-serving women 's players made quick work of Japanese opponents . 
000000000700

Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands , the 13th seed , was a 6-1 6-4 winner over Japan 's Nana Miyaga , while Czech veteran Helena Sukova prevailed over Yone Kamio 6-2 6-3 . 
340050000000000050340070340034000

Austrian Barbara Paulus , seeded 14th , also reached the second round with a 6-2 6-1 victory over Yi Jing-Qian of China .

TENNIS - STICH GLAD HE STAYED AFTER OPEN VICTORY . 
0030000700

Michael Stich nearly pulled out of the U.S. Open in protest over the men 's seeding fiasco but the former Wimbledon champion was glad he stayed after sweating out a four-set win on Monday over qualifier Tommy Haas . 
340000078000000000007000000000000000340

" I still feel it 's embarrassing what happened and I was about to pull out yesterday and say , ' That 's it , ' " said Stich , one of a host of men who cried foul over seeding procedures that forced an unprecedented remaking of the men 's draw last week . 
0000000000000000000000000000300000000000000000000000000

" But there are so many reasons to play , especially spectators and the kids who come out here and want to enjoy watching tennis , that I decided to stay . " 
000000000000000000000000000000000

In a break from tradition , the Open did not seed in strict accordance with ATP rankings , instead taking into account other factors that raised objections of favourtism toward U.S. players . 
000000070000000100000000000000500

One prominent player that did not stay for the Open was French Open champion Yvegeny Kafelnikov , who after being dropped three spots from his ATP ranking to a seventh seeding , withdrew and returned home to Russia . 
000000000707803400000000010000000000050

Kafelnikov had pulled out of last week 's tournament with a rib injury . 
30000000000000

At a news conference attended by approximately 50 players on Sunday , U.S. Davis Cup player Todd Martin expressed the players ' outrage at the seedings . 
000000000000578034000000000

" The way the U.S. Open has seeded here , tampering with the ranking system , has tarnished the image and reputation of this U.S. Open in the players ' mind , and we think that is damaging to our sport , " Martin said . 
0000780000000000000000007800000000000000000300

Stich said he felt the players ought to have organised an active protest . 
30000000000000

" I feel that we made it a little easy for the USTA . 
00000000000010

They did n't really get hurt as much as I think they should have , " said Stich . " 
00000000000000000300

I feel that we should have maybe just cancelled out the Monday , not show up today and start the tournament tomorrow . " 
000000000000000000000000

But once the 27-year-old Stich got on the court , he focused his energies on trying to win the year 's last Grand Slam . 
0000300000000000000000780

He took a positive first step with his 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 win over compatriot Haas on a sun-baked Grandstand court . 
0000000000000003000700

Others advancing early on Monday included 11th-seeded American Malivai Washington , the Wimbledon runner-up , Sweden 's Magnus Gustafsson , and two-time former French Open champion Sergi Bruguera of Spain , who will be Stich 's next opponent . 
000000073400700503400007803405000030000

The suspicion , however , lingers in Stich 's mind that U.S. Open officials did tamper with the seeding process in order to benefit homegrown players . 
000000030007800000000000000

" I get the feeling that everything is done here for the American players and they forget about all the other players , " said Stich , who lost the 1994 Open final to Andre Agassi . 
0000000000007000000000000300000700340

It was Agassi who was at the centre of the controversy that engulfed the tournament since the original draw was completed on Wednesday . 
003000000000000000000000

The flamboyant American star was bumped up two spots from his ATP ranking of eight to a seeding of six . 
007000000001000000000

" He ( Agassi ) should be seeded the way he is playing tennis right now , " said Stich about the unfairness of moving up Agassi , who made early exits from the French Open and Wimbledon . 
000300000000000000030000003000000078070

Stich , not seeded here for the first time since 1990 , might have benefitted from some fiddling with the seedings himself after Kafelnikov withdrew . 
30000000000000000000000300

Ranked 18th in the world , Stich might have been slipped into that spot ahead of Spain 's Felix Mantilla , who is 16th but had never been played in the Open and had been left out of the seedings originally . 
000000300000000050340000000000070000000000

But Stich did n't want to play that game . 
0300000000

" I think he deserves to be seeded as everybody else who is in the top 16 deserves to be seeded , " Stich said . 
00000000000000000000000300

the other elections will be held on September 14 , " OSCE spokeswoman Agota Kuperman told reporters in Sarajevo .

" I think that it would be very difficult to select which municipal elections would have to be cancelled . 
00000000000000000000

I think probably if the decision ( to cancell ) were to be taken it would probably be all municipal elections ..

More than 600,000 refugees have registered to vote in 55 countries around the world , representing about 20 per cent of Bosnia 's total electorate . 
00000000000000000000050000

They are due to begin voting on Wednesday , August 28 , just one day after the PEC is supposed to make its decision . 
0000000000000000010000000

Balloting inside Bosnia is scheduled for September 14 , when citizens are slated to elect municipal and cantonal assemblies , separate Moslem-Croat and Serb parliaments , a national House of Representatives and a three-man Presidency .

A Sarajevo daily newspaper , Dnevi Avaz , which is close to Bosnia 's Moslem nationalist SDA party , on Monday said the OSCE would postpone the municipal-level elections until the Spring of 1997 because of the refugee registration problems .

OSCE and independent monitors allege that Serb authorities have systematically discouraged refugees from registering to cast a ballot in the places they lived before the war . 
100000700000000000000000000

Instead , the refugees were said to have been directed by their authorities to vote from strategic towns which had Moslem majorities before the 43-month Bosnian war , but which are now underpopulated as a result of " ethnic cleansing " . 
000000000000000000007000070000000000000000

Diplomats explain the purpose of this electoral engineering is to secure Serb control over pivotal towns inside the 49 per cent of Bosnia known as the Serb republic , consolidating through the ballot box what was initially taken in war .

" In the run-up to elections , nationalistic political leaders are playing the ethnic / sectarian card , drumming up support within their constituencies by playing on bitter memories or fear . "

After truce , Lebed faces tougher Chechen problem .

Alexander Lebed may finally get to discuss his Chechen peace proposals with Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday after a lost weekend in the region when he was forced to abandon plans to sign a new political treaty with the separatist rebels . 
34000000700034000000000000000000000000000

It could be a sobering experience for the Kremlin security chief who , just two months after being appointed by the president and two heady weeks after taking charge of the Chechen crisis , had promised to wrap up the 20-month war by the weekend . 
0000000050000000000000000000000700000000000000

Despite a mood of compromise in the region after some of the worst fighting of the war , Lebed may be just finding out that concluding a long-term settlement , somewhere between rebel demands for independence and Moscow 's insistence that Chechnya remain part of Russia , will be no easy matter . 
00000000000000000030000000000000000005000500050000000

A chain-smoking former paratroop general with a sharp line in deadpan putdowns and a soldier 's knack for making life sound simple , Lebed managed to arrange an ambitious ceasefire in the region last week , days after the Russian army threatened to bomb its way back into the rebel-held Chechen capital Grozny . 
000000000000000000000003000000000000000700000000007050

He returned at the weekend , pledging to conclude a political settlement that would make this truce work where all others have failed . 
000000000000000000000000

But then he apparently thought better of it . 
000000000

Saying he needed to tidy up legal loose ends on the deal -- and also cover his back against unnamed pro-war schemers in Moscow -- he flew back to the capital empty-handed on Sunday . 
00000000000000000000000500000000000

He met Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday and , according to the press service of Lebed 's Security Council , could meet Yeltsin on Tuesday . 
0070034000000000030120003000

It was not clear if the start of Yeltsin 's holiday , announced later , would affect plans to talk . 
000000003000000000000

Moscow 's as yet undisclosed proposals on Chechnya 's political future have , meanwhile , been sent back to do the rounds of various government departments . 
500000050000000000000000000

It is not known what caused the delay in the peace plan . 
0000000000000

Speculation mounted last week that Lebed was operating out on a limb in Chechnya as Yeltsin , hardly seen since his reelection last month , kept out of sight and then gave an interview criticising his envoy just as he clinched a truce . 
00000300000005030000000000000000000000000000

But Chernomyrdin took pains at the weekend to insist Lebed was playing for a united team and that the proposals he took to rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov had been agreed by Yeltsin . 
030000000300000000000000034000030

If that were the case , it was unclear why Lebed suddenly found it necessary to have the deal verified in Moscow . 
00000000003000000000050

Lebed himself said he was concerned that powerful interests in Moscow , who have profited from the war and want it to go on , would seize on any inadequacy in the deal to remove him . 
3000000000500000000000000000000000000

Maskhadov warned that Lebed risked the same fate as a former Russian army commander in the region who sought a compromise and was blown up last year by -- so the Chechens say -- Russian forces . 
3003000000070000000000000000000700700

Maskhadov may also have made new demands on Lebed , forcing him to check back with the Kremlin on what he could offer . 
300000003000000005000000

A rebel spokesman said the two military men had come close to agreement on a face-saving formula acceptable to both sides and involving a referendum on independence at some future date . 
00000000000000000000000000000000

Chernomyrdin said voters should decide Chechnya 's future but stressed there was no question of the government letting the region quit the Russian Federation -- something Moscow fears could encourage separatist tendencies in other ethnic regions , particularly in the strategic North Caucasus . 
30000500000000000000005600500000000000000560

Lebed may be be finding that closing that political gap between the two sides is more difficult than just ending a war .

Russian President Boris Yeltsin began a new summer holiday on Monday but would remain in control of affairs of state , Interfax news agency said . 
70340000000000000000010000

" The head of state 's holiday has only just begun , " the agency quoted Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying , adding that the president was currently in a Kremlin residence near Moscow . 
0000000000000000340000000000050050

Interfax said Yastrezhembsky did not exclude that Yeltsin could spend some time in other places . 
1030000300000000

He would continue working on various documents and might meet " one state offical or another " . 
000000000000000000

" One must give B. Yeltsin a chance to rest and recover his health after the elections , " Interfax quoted Yastrezhembsky as saying . 
0000340000000000000103000

" ( Yeltsin ) controls internal and international policies , daily receives a big packet of documents from Moscow , which demand his intervention ...

Many of those documents return to the president 's administration the same day , " he said .

Yugo Zastava workers ' protest enters 2nd week .

BELGRADE 1996-08-26

Thousands of workers of Serbia 's Zastava arms factory entered the second week of protests on Monday over unpaid wages and the lack of a programme to revive the plant 's production . 
000050100000000000000000000000000

" We are stubborn , have strength and time to persist until our demands are met , " said the factory 's trade union secretary Dragutin Stanojlovic . 
0000000000000000000000000340

" We are united and we are waiting for the government to decide what to do with us . " 
00000000000000000000

Trade unions demanded payment of June and July wages and last year 's holiday pay , and called on government to develop a revival programme for the plant . 
00000000000000000000000000000

The former Yugoslav national army consumed 90 percent of Zastava 's pre-war output , but like the rest of Yugoslavia 's economy , the new army of Serbia and Montenegro is crippled by lack of funds . 
0070000001000000000500000005050000000

In Kragujevac where the plant is based , 9,000 to 10,000 people gathered in the central square to express their bitterness at what Stanojlovic called government indifference . 
0500000000000000000000030000

The ruling Socialist Party last week accused Serbia 's opposition of stirring up social unrest and using workers ' already difficult social position for their own interests . 
0012000500000000000000000000

" Late wages , no work and ( the lack of a ) production programme are the main reasons for their protests , " a senior member of the local Socialist Party branch told Reuters . 
000000000000000000000000000000120010

" But there is a significant influence of opposition parties that are collecting points ahead of coming elections . " 
00000000000000000000

Federal Yugoslav elections are due on November 3 . 
070000000

The party official said the union 's figure on the number of protesters was exaggerated . " 
00000000000000000

There were about 1,400 to 1,600 people at the protest today -- much less then last week . 
000000000000000000

" But there were more observers and passers by , " he said .

SVCD Bulgaria air traffic controllers to strike September 3 . 
1200000000

SOFIA 1996-08-26

Bulgarian air traffic controllers will go on strike on September 3 demanding higher pay , the chief of the Bulgarian association of air traffic controllers ( Bulatka ) said on Monday . 
70000000000000000007000000100000

Stefan Raichev told a news conference the strike by more than half of the 1,380 traffic controllers and technicians would paralyse traffic which has increased by 10 percent since last year . 
34000000000000000000000000000000

More than 1,500 planes per day fly over Bulgaria , in a strategic location between Europe and the Middle and the Far East , Raichev said . 
000000005000000500500560300

The director general of the air traffic service Valentin Valkov said last Friday that a controllers ' strike would be illegal . 
0000000034000000000000

Valkov said he could not curb the summer charter flights of national carrier Balkan Airlines , which carries thousands of foreign tourists to the Bulgarian Black Sea resorts . 
30000000000001200000000075600

But Raichev said it would be " discrimination " against the other airlines if only Balkan planes were guided in . 
030000000000000500000

" Under the law before launching the strike we have to sign an agreement with our employer for a minimal transport servicing of emergency flights , " Raichev said . 
000000000000000000000000000300

Raichev said a lock-out with military air controllers was impossible as they did not speak English . 
30000000000000070

The controllers are demanding the monthly wage be increased to $ 1,000 per month from the current $ 230 , as well as the resignation of the air traffic service 's management . 
000000000000000000000000000000000

They also demand the financial separation of the 350 air controllers from the technical staff .

00000000000300

Mostostal , based in southern Poland , wants to offer the bonds to large investors in a public offering , paying an annual coupon of no more than 80 percent of the yield of the benchmark 52-week T-bill . 
100005000000000000000000000000000000000

00000000122010000000000000500000

Grabowski also said shareholders approved the issue of 1.6 million shares for which the bonds could be exchanged , a ratio of 6.4 shares per bond . 
300000000000000000000000000

He also said shareholders approved the issue of 2.6 million new shares , two million of which are earmarked for large investors and 600,000 for retail domestic investors .

Kidnappers have seized a Dutch couple who manage a farm in northern Costa Rica and have demanded a $ 1.5 million ransom , authorities said on Monday .

Misael Valerio , head of border police at the Security Ministry , told reporters surveillance of the northern border with Nicaragua has been stepped up to keep the kidnappers from fleeing Costa Rica . 
3400000001200000000050000000000560

Preliminary reports said the couple were kidnapped on the " Altamira " farm , owned by Dutchman Richard Wisinga , at Aguas Zarcas de San Carlos near the Costa Rica-Nicaragua border . 
00000000005000007340056666005600

000000000000056660000000000000000

The reports said authorities found a statement , supposedly from the kidnappers , in the vehicle , addressed to Wisinga and demanding a $ 1.5 million ransom .

Interacciones brokerage on Monday raised its forecasts for 1996 gross domestic product growth to 4.3 percent from 3.8 percent , but it kept its 1997 projection unchanged at 4.5 percent , a statement said . 
10000000000000000000000000000000000

Economist Alonso Cervera said the revisions were chiefly fueled by stronger than expected growth of 7.2 percent in the second quarter and he forecast an annual GDP rise of 6.1 percent in the third quarter and 4.9 percent in Q4 .

Colombia 's peso closed lower at 1,044 after coming under pressure from dollar-buying by importers seeking to meet their commitments abroad , interbank dealers said . 
50000000000000000000000000

It was the second consecutive session that saw the peso , which ended at 1,041 Friday , close lower . 
00000000000000000000

" The ( dollar 's ) rise was due to demand from importers who have a lot of wire transfers accumulated , " one dealer said . 
000000000000000000000000000

Contributing to the peso 's weakness , another dealer said banks who might have sold greenbacks in Monday 's trading appeared to shy away from the market . 
0000000000000000000000000000

This , according to the trader , was typical of month-end position-squaring -- and the fact that a stronger U.S. currency helps limit some foreign exchange losses . 
0000000000000000000500000000

Dealers reported 355 trades for a total of $ 142 million and said the peso hit an intra-day high of 1,037 before heading lower into the close .

" We did n't see anything from Singapore operators either . 
00000005000

It 's a pretty quiet day , " one foreign bank dealer said .

Spot rupiah was quoted at 2,342.0 / 42.5 at 0915 GMT , unchanged from the opening level . 
000000000070000000

It was softer in the morning due to relatively ample rupiah liquidity but recovered later .

Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,342.00 / 42.45 and 2,341.5 / 42.0 , respectively . 
0000000000000000

Another dealer said operators were reluctant to unload rupiah despite ample conditions due to the month-end factor . 
000000000000000000

" There are two factors which determine the market at present . 
000000000000

The liquidity at month-end and the next court hearing scheduled for Thursday , " the dealer said .

The factions reached a ceasefire on Friday after a week of fierce fighting which had put an end to a truce agreed a year earlier . 
00000000000000000000000000

" The PUK leadership who pledged to end fighting and cooperate with the latest U.S. initiative started a major military offensive against KDP positions , " the KDP said in a statement . 
001000000000005000000010000100000

It said heavy fighting started at midnight in the region dividing the two warring factions , with the PUK aiming to break through to KDP 's headquarters in Salahuddin .

It is not clear when the conference will be held .

A 12-year-old Florida boy hanged himself in his backyard just hours before he was due to start at a new school on Monday , police said . 
005000000000000000000000000

Samuel Graham , who told his family earlier that he was nervous about starting at a new school because he feared teasing about his weight problem , had been due to spend his first day at Parkway Middle School Monday , police said .

U.S. Midwest hog market seen steady Tuesday - trade . 
5600000000

CHICAGO 1996-08-26 
50

Midwest direct cash hog prices Tuesday were seen steady following strong demand Monday that lifted prices as much as $ 1.50 per cwt in some areas , livestock dealers said . 
5000000000000000000000000000000

The demand was sparked by Saturday 's active slaughter , which left some packers short on supplies to get Monday operations started , they said . 
00000000000000000000000000

Top prices in Iowa / southern Minnesota Tuesday were expected to range from mostly $ 59.50 to $ 60.00 , steady following a $ 0.50 - $ 1.50 jump Monday . 
0005005000000000000000000000000

Illinois tops were seen matching Monday 's at $ 59.00 with tops in Indiana at $ 57.50 . 
500000000000050000

However , USDA reported tops of $ 58.00 in Illinois and in Iowa / southern Minnesota , $ 60.00 on some hogs Monday . 
001000000500500500000000

Attempts to move prices higher again Tuesday could be offset by expected increased hog marketings this week , sources said . 
000000000000000000000

Producers were expected to ship as many hogs as they can ahead of the Labor Day holiday weekend , they said . 
0000000000000078000000

Demand for hogs is expected to be light by the end of the week , as the industry prepares for Labor Day , Monday , September 1 when most U.S. packers will be closed .

Gore presents new image of lead attack dog . 
300000000

Michael Posner 
34

CHICAGO 1996-08-26 
50

No more mild-mannered and meek Al Gore , the vice president and likely heir apparent to President Bill Clinton , emerged on Monday as the new Democratic attack dog leading a front-line assault on Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich . 
000003400000000003400000007000000034010340

While Clinton takes a train trip to the Democratic Convention that will renominate him on Wednesday for a second term , Gore is the bright star in the convention city now . 
03000000780000000000030000000000

Crowds anxiously wait for his appearances , thrusting out hands for him to grip as they scream " 12 more years " -- a wishful hope to eight years of Gore after a Clinton re-election . 
000000000000000000000000000000300300

Over a 15-hour span from Sunday evening to Monday morning , so many people jammed Gore events that the fire marshal stopped members of Congress , reporters and others from entering a pro-Israel rally and a meeting of the New York delegation . 
0000000000000003000000001000000070000005600

In his appearances , the often stiff and wooden Gore seemed transformed into a new energetic , gesturing " pol " as he ripped into Republican presidential nominee Dole and Gingrich , who has emerged as the favorite right-wing foil of Democrats . 
0000000003000000000000000700303000000000070

Gore told a roaring labor rally of about 1,000 union workers that Dole and Gingrich were the virtual personifaction of evil , without even mentioning that former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp is Dole 's running mate . 
3000000000003030000000000000034030000

" With equal measures of ignorance and audacity this two-headed monster of Dole and Gingrich has been launching an all out assault on decades of progress of behalf of working men and women , " Gore said to whoops of " 12 more years . " 
0000000000003030000000000000000000030000000000

" They want to drive you out of politics and they ca n't , " he added . " 
0000000000000000000

They want to silence your voices in elections . " 
0000000000

At a downtown hotel Monday , the 48-year-old Gore gave Wisconsin delegates a taste again of the new Gore . 
00000000305000000030

" I want you to ask this question . 
000000000

What would Wisconsin face if the same extremist coalition , the Gingrich / Dole Congress , also controlled the executive branch ? " 
00500000000122200000000

Gore said . 
300

Noting the next presidential term will probably see two or three Supreme Court justice nominations , he warned , " Their extremist agenda would come out of the Gingrich Congress , into and through the Dole White House , down through the Supreme Court . " 
0000000000012000000000000000120000012200001200

He painted a scene of horrors he saw if Republicans controlled the White House and the Congress they hold now . " 
0000000007005600100000

Our personal and religious liberties would be at risk . 
0000000000

Medicare would be at risk of withering on the vine . 
70000000000

Medicaid would be at risk of being taken away from poor children . 
7000000000000

Education would be at risk . 
000000

The environment would be at risk from the polluters that control that coalition , " he said . 
000000000000000000

His new style mixed an assault on Republicans with what he sees as " productive opportunity , a vision for the future that lifts up working families , that builds Wisconsin stronger , that builds America stronger . 
00000007000000000000000000000050000500

With your help we can re-elect Bill Clinton . " 
0000003400

Dole 's tax cut plans were called " deja-voodoo economics .... It 's a warmed-over plan that failed and drove our economy into a ditch . 
30000000000000000000000000

We got burned once and we wo n't let that happen to our nation again . " 
00000000000000000

Gore ridiculed Dole 's defense of the tobacco industry , praised Clinton for " courage " in advancing regulations of it . 
3030000000030000000000

To the delegates of Wisconsin , a leading dairy state , Gore had the right audience in poking fun at Dole 's comparison to addiction to tobacco to those who ca n't tolerate milk . 
00005000000300000000300000000000000

" Some people say milk is bad for you , " Gore said as Wisconsin delegates held aloft a plastic inflated cow . 
00000000000300500000000

He praised Clinton for vetoing the Republican Congress ' attempt to repeal parts of the Clean Air Act , and criticized Republicans for " slashing money to combat drugs in schools . " 
003000710000000788000700000000000

" The choice has never been starker , the stakes today have never been higher , " Gore said . " 
000000000000000003000

We 're not going to let them get away with that . "

Actor Reeve highlights Democrats ' first night . 
03070000

CHICAGO 1996-08-26 
50

The highlights of the first day of the Democratic convention on Monday were expected to feature a mix of party leaders and people who have overcome adversity . 
0000000070000000000000000000

Among the latter were gun control advocate Sarah Brady and actor Christopher Reeve and the politicians included Rep . 
0000000340034000078

Richard Gephardt and Sen . 
34000

Thomas Daschle . 
340

Here are thumbnail profiles of the convention 's key Monday speakers . 
000000000000

Sarah Brady -- The nation 's toughest gun control law is named after Ronald Reagan 's press secretary James Brady but it was his wife who was the major force behind its passage . 
3400000000000340003400000000000000

As head of Handgun Control Inc. , Sarah Brady , 54 , campaigned nonstop for tough gun control in the years following the shooting of her husband and then President Reagan in 1981 . 
0001220340000000000000000000003000

Her reward was the passage in 1993 of the " Brady Bill " which requires a mandatory five-day waiting period for purchase of handguns and also mandates background checks for would-be gun purchasers . 
0000000000780000000000000000000000

Reagan recovered fully from his wounds but Brady , who was close to death after being shot by John Hinckley Jr . 
3000000300000000003440

, suffered serious brain damage . 
000000

Sarah was Brady 's second wife and they have a son , James Scott Brady Jr . 
30300000000034440

Before the assassination attempt , she had worked for Republican congressmen and for the Republican Party . 
00000000070000120

Christopher Reeve -- Reeve was best known for playing the comic book hero Superman in four movies but his greatest heroics came in real life . 
34030000000003000000000000

Reeve , an accomplished rider who owned several horses , suffered multiple injuries including two shattered neck vertebrae when he was thrown from his horse at an equestrian event in Culpepper , Virginia , on May 27 , 1995 . 
3000000000000000000000000000005050000000

Almost entirely paralyzed , Reeve underwent extensive surgery to fuse the vertebrae to the base of the skull and prevent any further damage to his spine . 
000030000000000000000000000

That allowed him to be moved to a semi-upright position . 
00000000000

Over time he regained the power of speech , so much so that he was asked to address the opening night of the Democratic National Convention . 
000000000000000000000007880

Reeve , 43 , was classically trained as an actor but became the prototypical handsome leading man . 
300000000000000000

He performed in summer stock and soap operas before being plucked as an almost unknown to play the lead in " Superman " and three sequels . 
000000000000000000000300000

Richard Gephardt -- Gephardt , House Democratic leader , is a politician with a " Mr Clean " reputation who sought the presidency eight years ago and is widely believed to still have ambitions for the job . 
34030170000000034000000000000000000000

Gephardt , 55 , the son of a milkman from a working class district of St. Louis , is a consummate congressional insider , sufficiently skilled in compromise and the ways of the legislature to manage the often-unruly House Democrats . 
30000000000000056000000000000000000000170

A former lawyer , he was in the front line of President Bill Clinton 's battle with the Republican-led Congress over the budget but has opposed the president 's decision to sign the Republican-written welfare reform bill . 
00000000000034000071000000000000070000

He advocated tough action against foreign countries to cut U.S. trade deficits but sometimes been out of step with the party 's liberal wing . 
0000000005000000000000000

He was an opponent of abortion until 1986 and voted for President Ronald Reagan 's big tax cut bill . 
00000000000034000000

Gephardt , a red-haired square-jawed man , is a less than fiery orator . 
30000000000000

His 1988 bid for the Democratic nomination only took off after he recreated himself as a firebreathing reformer of the establishment , standing up for blue collar workers and farmers . 
0000070000000000000000000000000

Tom Daschle -- Daschle , 48 , was largely unknown outside Washington and his state of South Dakota when he surprisingly beat more prominent rivals to become Senate Democratic leader after the party lost its majority to the Republicans in 1994 . 
340300000005000056000000000170000000007000

A mild-mannered and youthful man who rose rapidly after entering the Senate in 1987 , he presented himself as a Midwest moderate , as a Democratic winner in a Republican state able to unite Senate factions . 
0000000000010000000050000700070000100

Concern that he might be steamrollered by the vastly more experienced Republican leader Bob Dole was dispelled when he showed a tough edge , outmaneuvering Dole in a wrangle over scrapping a gas tax and raising the federal minimum wage . 
00000000000703400000000003000000000000000

In his early Senate years he was seen as a " prairie populist " , working on legislation protecting farmers ' prices and also on compensating veterans sickened by Agent Orange defoliant spraying in the Vietnam War . 
00010000000000000000000000000780000780

Daschle was a key player in President Bill Clinton 's failed attempt at sweeping healthcare changes but when he became minority leader he declared he would be no water-carrier for the White House . 
3000000340000000000000000000000560

He has made clear he opposed Clinton 's signing of the Republican-initiated welfare reform bill . 
0000003000070000

He has spent his adult life in politics , coming to Congress as an aide in 1972 after three years in the Air Force and then being elected to the House of Representatives himself in 1978 .

U.S. boy , 13 , accused of murdering adoptive mother .

DALLAS 1996-08-26

A 13-year-old Dallas boy has been charged with murdering his adoptive mother over the weekend , police said on Monday . 
005000000000000000000

Margaret McCullough , 55 , was found dead in her home on Saturday with gunshot wounds to the head . 
34000000000000000000

Police , who at first thought her son had been kidnapped , found him on Sunday with a friend in his mother 's car in Oklahoma and arrested him . 
000000000000000000000000050000

A shotgun and a .357 handgun were found in the car . 
000000000000

A police spokesman said the boy was being questioned . " 
00000000000

They are talking to him now about the motive and everything else . " 
00000000000000

McCullough had adopted the boy , who was the grandson of her late husband , shortly after his birth but neighbours said they often had loud arguments .

NWE oil products mixed , holiday dulls trade .

NWE oil products were mixed on Monday but markets were becalmed because of a public holiday in the United Kingdom , traders said . 
000000000000000000560000

An explosion at Repsol 's Puertollano refinery , which killed four workers , had not affected output of oil products , an official said . 
0001050000000000000000000

" The plant is functioning as usual , " Jose Manuel Prieto , director of personnel , told Spanish state television . 
0000000003440000007000

Gasoline prices were notionally unchanged from Friday despite sagging NYMEX numbers , with the arbitrage window to the U.S. considered closed for the moment . 
0000000000000000005000000

Eurograde barges were offered at $ 207 fob ARA for Amsterdam-Rotterdam barrels , and at $ 206 for full ARA material . 
0000000000500000000000

" There is no market at the moment , " one Rotterdam trader said . " 
0000000000050000

Maybe sentiment is a little bit weaker but prices have not changed . " 
00000000000000

Outright gas oil prices were notionally softer as the NYMEX heating oil contract headed lower , and following news that the Indian Oil Corp ( IOC ) had issued a tender to buy only 120,000 tonnes of high speed diesel for October . 
0000000000000000000001220100000000000000000

Asian traders had earlier expected an IOC tender for around 400,000 tonnes . 
7000001000000

ARA gas oil barges were quiet although one trader said he had seen offers at $ 1 a tonne over September IPE for prompt barrels , while Antwerp material was available for 0-50 cents over September . 
0000000000000000000000000005000000000

The IOC tender had " a bearish impact , but not a great impact , " one German player said . 
010000000000000007000

Fuel oil markets were also listless . 
0000000

Offers were around a dollar a tonne higher at $ 102 fob ARA but bids were scarce .

Brush Wellman comments on beryllium lawsuits .

CLEVELAND 1996-08-26

Brush Wellman Inc said Monday that 10 of 24 lawsuits involving chronic beryllium disease have been dismissed since July 1 . 
122000000000000000000

The leading U.S. beryllium producer said in a conference call it has traditionally been pro-active regarding the workplace disease , a lung ailment which can affects a small percent of people whose immune systems are susceptible . 
0050000000000000000000000000000000000

Of the 14 remaining suits , 10 were filed by employees of industrial Brush Wellman customers and Brush Wellman liability in such suits is typically covered by insurance , Timothy Reid , vice president of corporate communications , said on the call . 
0000000000000120012000000000034000000000000

The company was responding to an article in Sunday 's New York Times . 
00000000001220

Chelsea makes political debut on Clinton train trip .

CHILLICOTHE , Ohio 1996-08-25 
5050

- Chelsea Clinton , until now carefully shielded from the exposure of public life , made her political debut on Sunday on her father 's whistlestop train trip . 
03400000000000000000000000000

Chelsea , 16 , was at President Bill Clinton 's side as he rode the rails through parts of West Virginia , Kentucky and Ohio , and was introduced at every stop . 
300000034000000000056050500000000

She even worked ropelines , shaking hands with excited fans . 
00000000000

Hillary Rodham Clinton saw her husband and daughter off on the trip in Huntington , West Virginia and then went on to Chicago to begin a rigorous Democratic Convention schedule . 
3440000000000505600000500007800

Asked if Chelsea would have a prominent role in the campaign , White House spokesman Mike McCurry said : " She 'll do what she did today when she can . 
0030000000005603400000000000000

She has to go back to school . " 
000000000

The president 's daughter is going into her senior year of high school at Sidwell Friends School , a private school in Washington . 
000000000000001220000050

McCurry said Chelsea has asked to go on the train trip and attend the convention where her father will be renominated , but said her exposure did not signal the start of a new political career . 
3030000000000000000000000000000000000

Chelsea " is a very poised young lady , but she 's not that much interested in politics , " the spokesman said .

Dutch closing share market report . 
700000

AMSTERDAM 1996-08-26 
50

Dutch shares drifted to a lower close on Monday , dragged down by weakness in the domestic bond market and turnover depressed by the UK bank holiday and lack of any significant U.S. economic data . 
700000000000000000000000500000005000

The AEX index of leading shares closed 4.54 points easier at 556.19 , the day 's low . 
070000000000000000

The Dutch market had been on the defensive all day but a softer start to Wall Street did little to boost sentiment in late trade , dealers said . 
07000000000000056000000000000

" It was always going to be a tough day with participation so low . 
000000000000000

But the only thing really worrying the market was the bonds , and that dragged us lower , " one dealer said . 
00000000000000000000000

Stocks were down across the board , with Dutch PTT topping the volume list and closing down 1.90 guilders at 58.70 . 
0000000012000000000000

The post and telecoms firm posted an 8.5 percent rise in first half earnings on Friday , just below analysts ' expectations . 
00000000000000000000000

IHC Caland reported first half results well under forecasts on Monday and the shares suffered as a result . 
1200000000000000000

They were trading unchanged just before the release of figures but closed 2.40 guilders down at 80.70 after it reported net profits of 34.9 million guilders against 36.6 million last year and estimates ranging from 37.5 to 47.2 million . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

IHC also forecast post tax earnings rising 21 percent for the full year . 
10000000000000

Banking group ING traded ex-dividend today and finished 0.60 guilders weaker at 52.90 as a result . 
00100000000000000

But Nutricia shrugged off its ex-div tag to soar a further 4.10 guilders to 214.40 continuing its explosive rally sparked by the 51 percent jump in first half net profits last week , which set the market alight on Friday , sending the shares up 18.40 at 210.00 by the close . 
0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Engineering concern Stork started the day well as the shares attracted some follow-through interest to the announcement late on Friday that its Fokker Aviation unit had won a major order . 
0010000000000000000000120000000

But the rally was short-lived and Stork ended just 0.20 up at 51.00 guilders .

Tapie to quit French assembly seat as film opens . 
3007000000

PARIS 1996-08-26 
50

Former businessman and soccer boss Bernard Tapie said that he would give up his seat in the National Assembly by Wednesday , the day a film by Claude Lelouche in which he stars opens in France . 
0000034000000000012000000003400000050

" I will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens , " he said in a broadcast interview . 
0000000000000000000000

" Just about , " he told Europe 1 radio when asked whether he had sent his letter of resignation to Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin . 
00000001200000000000010340

A Seguin spokeswoman confirmed that no letter or call had yet been received . 
03000000000000

Tapie , 53 , was resigning just ahead of expected government action to eject him from the Assembly following a finding by the Supreme Court that he was bankrupt and thus ineligible for public office for a five-year period . 
3000000000000000010000012000000000000000

Tapie , the target of a blizzard of legal actions over his now-destroyed business empire and the Marseille soccer team he once ran , has a starring role in Lelouche 's " Homme , femmes : mode d'emploi " ( Men , women : instructions for use ) . 
3000000000000000010000000000030000000000000000000

He plays a power-hungry lawyer in the movie described as " a tender and cruel comedy " by Lelouche , who is making his 35th film . 
000000000000000000300000000

" I have paid too dearly for mixing two careers , " Tapie said . " 
0000000000003000

In France , you cannot be a film artist and a national politician at the same time . 
050000000000000000

That is why I will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens . " 
00000000000000000

Justice Minister Jacques Toubon began last month the formal process of ejecting Tapie from the French parliament as well as stripping him of his seat in the European parliament . 
003400000000300700000000000700

The French procedure was expected to be completed before October 2 , when the National Assembly is to reconvene after a summer break , but the European procedure was expected to take longer . 
0700000000000012000000000070000000

Tapie 's lawyer has said he intends to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in an effort to prevent or delay the loss of his European seat . 
300000000001222200000000000700

But such an appeal , even if the court were to accept the case , which it is not obliged to do , would not suspend enforcement of the French judgement against him . 
0000000000000000000000000000070000

Tapie faces a probable spell in prison after he loses his parliamentary immunity , since two appeal courts have confirmed jail sentences of eight and six months against him for tax fraud and rigging a soccer match . 
30000000000000000000000000000000000000

He is appealing in both cases to the Supreme Court .

The new pact expires on September 3 .

RABOBANK [ RABN.CN ] SEES H2 NET GROWTH UNDER 10 PCT . 
100000000000

AMSTERDAM 1996-08-26 
50

Dutch co-operative bank Rabobank Nederland BA 's net profit growth might slow to less than than 10 year percent in the second half of 1996 , executive board chairman Herman Wijffels said on Monday . 
70012200000000000000000000000340000

The unlisted bank earlier announced a 1996 interim net profit of 853 million guilders , up 21.5 percent on the 702 million guilders reported in the first half of 1995 . 
0000000000000000000000000000000

He said second-half profit growth would depend on customer demand for loans , which was already easing , and the performance of financial markets , which were strong in the first half and boosted securities , trading and underwriting income . 
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

" We expect reasonable growth in the second half . 
0000000000

Maybe it will be in single-digits , " Wijffels told Reuters . 
000000003010

He said growth in customer demand in the first half was 50 percent above normal but it was hard to maintain this pace . 
000000000000000000000000

Rabobank 's net profit was 1.43 billion guilders in 1995 . 
10000000000

The bank earlier warned that profit growth would slow in the second half , citing the increasing momentum in profit growth in the comparative period of 1995 and increased investment . 
0000000000000000000000000000000

But Wijffels was unable to quantify second half investment to improve and extend domestic and offshore services .

Thai PM proposes Sept 18 for no-confidence debate . 
700000000

BANGKOK 1996-08-26 
50

Thai Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa on Monday proposed September 18 as the date for parliamentary debate on an opposition no-confidence motion accusing him of incompetence . 
70034000000000000000000000

The president of parliament had earlier said September 11 could be set for the debate . 
0000000000000000

The opposition motion against Banharn accuses him of being incompetent , lacking ethical leadership and alleges his administration is corrupt . 
000030000000000000000

His critics allege he may be attempting to delay the debate . 
000000000000

Banharn has denied the accusations and said he is ready to clear himself in parliament . 
3000000000000000

" In my opinion September 18 would be a convenient date for the government to answer questions . 
000000000000000000

This has nothing to do with the accusation that I am trying to escape the debate , " Banharn told reporters after meeting coalition partners . 
00000000000000000030000000

Banharn 's 13-month-old , six-party coalition government controls 209 seats in the 391-seat lower house of parliament . 
300000000000000000

Political infighting within Banharn 's Chart Thai party has raised doubts whether he can hold his supporters together and defeat the opposition motion , political analysts said . 
0003012000000000000000000000

" We are still waiting to fix a date . 
0000000000

September 18 is regarded as tentative because we still have not received the order to fix it on the agenda , " said an official at parliament 's agenda section . 
0000000000000000000000000000000

The last no-confidence debate against Banharn 's coalition in May was won by the government .

European bourses closed mixed on Tuesday with London clawing back most of the day 's losses despite an unsteady start on wall Street , hit by inflation worries . 
70000005000000000000012000000

The dollar weakened during the day with many dealers sidelined because of uncertainty over Tokyo 's monetary direction ahead of the important Japanese Tankan economic survey out on Wednesday . 
000000000000005000000071000000

But it recovered at the close of trade . 
000000000

Stocks in London started the week badly after a three-day weekend , slipping 0.3 percent , but bargain-hunters later moved in and the FTSE index recovered most of the lost ground to end only just in negative ground . 
005000000000000000000007000000000000000

Tuesday 's patchy showing in London followed a string of records last week , culminating in Friday 's trading high of 3,911 , fuelled by a wave of European interest rate cuts . 
000005000000000000000000000070000

The London bourse drew little help from the unsettled morning on Wall Street , which slipped in and out of positive ground after a stronger-than-expected August consumer confidence report refuelled inflation fears , pulling U.S. Treasuries back from their early peaks . 
050000000005600000000000000000000012000000

Shortly after the report appeared showing the confidence index rising to 109.4 in August from a revised 107.0 in July , Wall Street relinquished virtually all its morning gains . 
000000000000000000000560000000

" Treasuries remain very sensitive to any indication of a strong economy and we 're still in that summer doldrum period of light trading , " said Alan Ackerman , market strategist at Fahnestock & Co . " 
01000000000000000000000000034000012200

Consequently , stocks and bonds are both subject to rapid swings . " 
0000000000000

Frankfurt was the one bright spot in Europe . 
500000050

Floor trading ended up 0.25 percent and the computerised IBIS index climbed nearly 0.4 percent , given a push by the performance of chemical shares . " 
000000000700000000000000000

The market is trading 100 percent on fundamentals at the moment as interest rate fantasy disappears -- it 's all company news , " said one trader . 
0000000000000000000000000000

French shares ended slightly down amid growing unease about a difficult autumn for the government which also weighed on the franc , dealers said . 
7000000000000000000000000

Bond prices were weaker and the franc was quoted at 3.4210 per mark for the first time since August 13 as worries about the government 's autumn budget and a weak U.S. currency lifted the mark and squeezed French investments . 
00000000000000000000000000000005000000700

The dollar , which dropped sharply on Monday because of jitters over the Japanese Tankan survey , weakened further in quiet trading but regained losses to end the day close to Monday 's levels . 
00000000000007100000000000000000000

" Besides the Tankan , there 's nothing really until the U.S. jobs numbers next week , " said a UK bank corporate dealer . " 
00010000000500000000500000

There is still the summer malaise hanging over the market . " 
000000000000

Foreign exchange markets regard the Tankan report as an important indication of the country 's future monetary policy direction . 
00000100000000000000

If it points to weakness in the economy , the report will help the dollar regain some lost ground as speculation of a near-term rise in Japanese interest rates will evaporate . 
00000000000000000000000000700000

The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent .

Armed hijackers believed to be Iraqis released between 60 and 70 people on Tuesday from a Sudan Airways plane carrying 199 passengers and crew that landed in London after being diverted on a flight from Khartoum to Amman , authorities said . 
000007000000000012000000000500000005050000

A spokesman for Stansted airport said that the unidentified hijackers were demanding to see a British-based member of the Iraqi Community Association , called Mr Sadiki , and that police were trying to trace him . 
000500000000000700012200030000000000

Police spokeswoman Kim White said police had already contacted Sadiki and were trying to arrange to bring him to Stansted , 30 miles ( 48 km ) north-east of London , to talk to the hijackers . 
0034000003000000000500000000050000000

The hijackers started to release people for the Airbus plane in batches of 10 , starting with women and children , in what police described as a " controlled release " .

FEATURE - " Eco terrorists " target UK builders .

LONDON 1996-08-27

Ecological warfare has broken out across the British construction industry , striking some of the biggest corporates as activists give up peaceful protests and seek to hit builders where it hurts -- their profit margins . 
000000070000000000000000000000000000

Described by one British company as " eco-terrorism " , it is seen as the new business risk of the 1990s . 
0007000000000000000000

Famous names like Tarmac Plc , Costain Group Plc and ARC , a unit of conglomerate Hanson Plc , have all been targeted . 
000120122010000012000000

Activist groups are no longer seen by British firms as a harmless , badly organised ragbag of students and hippies . 
000000070000000000000

" You only have to see them in action at protests , " said David Harding , spokesman at ARC , Hanson 's aggregates company . " 
000000000000003400010100000

They walk around with mobile phones and camera equipment , they communicate and gather support for demos via the Internet -- we 're talking about a highly sophisticated organisation . " 
0000000000000000000700000000000

One road protestor under the codename Steady Eddie told construction journal " Building " earlier this year , " If it comes down to full-scale economic warfare , we will aim to drive them out of business . " 
000000340000100000000000000000000000000

As well as financial threats , companies also emphasise the " terror " tactics used . 
0000000000000000

Costain 's contract to build the controversial Newbury bypass , which runs through a conservation area , has led to violent protests delaying building , bomb threats , staff intimidation and picketing of chief executive Alan Lovell 's home . 
1000000500000000000000000000000000034000

A Costain spokesman told Reuters : " We 've had all sorts of protests at the head office and the chief executive 's house . 
0100100000000000000000000

But it 's when it gets to the ( employee ) families -- that it goes across the line . " 
000000000000000000000

Tactics used by some underground groups including the cryptic Berkshire Wood Elves , which distribute leaflets with instructions on home-made explosives , are now the subject of a police investigation . 
0000000001220000000000000000000

Other larger activist groups include Earth First , The Land is Ours , Alarm UK and Road Alert . 
0000012012220120120

The groups have targeted specific projects like the Newbury bypass and the M3 motorway through Twyford Down in the southern county of Hampshire . 
000000005000500560000050

But they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road building programme and out-of-town superstores which they say create more traffic , pollution and damage local communities . 
00000000000000000000000000000000

The government has slashed its road-building spending . 
00000000

Although protests may have contributed to the decision it has been seen primarily as economic rather than ecological . 
0000000000000000000

Graham Watts , chief executive of the Construction Industry Council , said : " I do n't think many firms involved in tendering for sensitive projects realise the impact environmental activity has on the cost of running a project . 
3400000122000000000000000000000000000000

" But they are more alert than they were 3-4 years ago . 
0000000000000

There 's no doubt it 's a big issue now . " 
000000000000

He says the damage comes in two forms : " Tangible -- in the form of extra costs , additional security , threats to staff and the more intangible damage caused by negative publicity . " 
000000000000000000000000000000000000

Watts said the cost of protesting can be heavy once the company is locked into a contract . 
300000000000000000

" I do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss . " 
0000000000000000000000000000000000

ARC says it 's not just contractors in the front line but also suppliers like itself . 
10000000000000000

Its own quarries came under attack after it emerged that it may be a supplier for the Newbury bypass . 
00000000000000000500

" It was called the " First Battle of the Newbury bypass ' , " said ARC 's Harding . 
00000078888800001030

" We had 300 Earth First protestors invade and occupy our site . 
0000120000000

Hundreds of thousands of pounds ( dollars ) of damage was done in one day . 
0000000000000000

Plus there was the knock-on cost of lost production and extra security in future . " 
0000000000000000

Simon Brown , analyst at investement bank UBS , said this new phenomenon has led to a change in the way the industry evaluates project risk . 
340000010000000000000000000

" When talking to Tarmac about the M3 link ( through Twyford Down ) they made it fairly clear that their risk assessment methods have been changed and now involve a very clear environmental risk analysis . " 
00001005000560000000000000000000000000

Harding says others have done the same . " 
300000000

As a result of eco-terrorism we are looking at controversial jobs more closely to see if the profit margins are wide enough to cover things like extra security . " 
000000000000000000000000000000

For an industry already suffering from razor-thin margins , overcapacity and stagnant demand , eco-terrorism is the latest bizarre twist in the construction sector 's tale of woe . 
00000000000000000000000000000

London Carnival ends in high spirits . 
7800000

LONDON 1996-08-26

London 's annual Notting Hill Carnival , the largest in Europe and second in the world only to Rio , ended peacefully on Monday with an estimated 800,000 revellers singing and dancing the day away in high spirits . 
500788000050000000500000000000000000000

Police said they made 30 arrests and there were two stabbings . 
000000000000

But there was no repeat of the ugly scenes that used to scar the street festival , and police praised the crowds over the two days of festivities as good-natured . 
0000000000000000000000000000000

Around 400 police were wounded in riots in 1976 when the carnival , now in its 31st year , acquired its darker reputation from which it is now only slowly recovering . 
00000000000000000000000000000000

Shopkeepers still board up their windows and many residents leave town for the weekend , but for four or five years there has been no disorder and relatively little crime .

The bank 's governor Sudradjat Djiwandono was quoted as saying on Monday about 5.4 billion rupiah of the seven billion rupiah had been recovered .

GOLF - PLAYERS DIVIDED ON CART REQUEST FOR OLAZABAL . 
0000000030

NORTHAMPTON , England 1996-08-27 
5050

Seve Ballesteros and Colin Montgomerie are divided on whether Jose Maria Olazabal should be allowed to return to the European PGA Tour using a motorised cart to transport him around the course . 
340340000344000000078800000000000

The Spaniard has not played for nearly a year because of rheumatoid arthritis in both his feet , and organisers of a pairs event to be staged in Bordeaux , France from October 17 to 20 have been asked to provide him with a buggy . 
0700000000000000000000000000505000000000000000

" If the ( Tour 's tournament ) committee decides to change the rule I would not be against it , " said Ballesteros , Olazabal 's compatriot and Ryder Cup captain . 
000070000000000000000003030007800

But commitee member Montgomerie said it could set an unhelpful precedent . " 
0003000000000

I know Olly 's situation is very unfortunate , but I do n't think we can start giving dispensations , " he said . " 
0030000000000000000000000

You 've got to have a rule for everybody and I do n't think it 's feasible . " 
0000000000000000000

The use of carts is generally prohibited in the professional game , and if Olazabal is allowed to use one in Bordeaux , he might then request one for the qualifying tournaments for next year 's Ryder Cup .

Jimmy Thomson became Scotland 's first managerial casualty of the season on Tuesday when he quit Raith Rovers , bottom of the premier division . 
3405000000000000120000000

Thomson resigned after the club 's directors asked him to return to his previous position as youth team coach .

" Regrettably Jimmy has felt unable to accept that offer , and has accordingly left the club . "

005000000

BUCHAREST 1996-08-27

The Romanian Soccer Federation has banned first division club Jiul Petrosani 's president Miron Cozma for two years for headbutting a visiting team player , a federation statement said . 
012200000120034000000000000000

Romania 's soccer bosses also fined Cozma , a well-known miners ' union leader , 10 million lei ( $ 3000 ) for the half-time attack on Dinamo Bucharest 's Danut Lupu last Sunday . 
50000030000000000000000000012034000

Miners led by Cozma rioted in Bucharest in 1990 and 1991 , bringing down the reformist government of premier Petre Roman . 
0003005000000000000340

Cozma is awaiting trial for assault and criminal damage in a bar in his home town of Petrosan , 300 kms west of Bucharest . 
3000000000000000050000050

The attack on Lupu came during a tunnel skirmish between opposing players as they left the field . 
000300000000000000

" Cozma 's blow was not too painful because I 'm a tall man , " Lupu told Reuters on Tuesday . 
0300000000000000301000

Lupu is one of the tallest players in Romania 's first division , towering over Cozma by some 17 cms , 
300000005000000300000

Jiul Petrosani , promoted to the first division this year , won the league game 1-0 .

Stefan Edberg produced some of his vintage best on Tuesday to extend his grand run at the Grand Slams by toppling Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek in straight sets at the U.S. Open . 
340000000000000007800703400000780

Edberg , competing in the 54th consecutive and final Grand Slam event of his illustrious career , turned back the clock at Stadium Court with a flowing 6-3 6-3 6-3 serve-and-volley victory over the fifth-seeded Dutchman . 
3000000007800000000000560000000000070

" It 's a win that I can be proud of , " said the 30-year-old Swede , winner of two U.S. Opens and six Grand Slam titles in all . " 
00000000000000007000050007800000

It 's never easy to beat the Wimbledon champion . " 
00000007000

Edberg , who has said he will retire at season 's end , made it look easy under gray skies at the National Tennis Centre . 
30000000000000000000005660

The unseeded Swede struck quickly , breaking Krajicek in the first game and never let loose his grip on the one hour 44 minute match as he served and volleyed with the grace that made him one of the dominant players of his time . 
007000030000000000000000000000000000000000000

" There 's not doubt about it , Richard was definitely off his game and I took advantage , " said Edberg . 
00000000300000000000030

" I still have my days where I feel great out there . " 
00000000000000

Also reaching the second round were top-seeded defending champion Pete Sampras , a 6-2 6-2 6-1 winner over last minute replacement Jimy Szymanski of Venezuela , called on after Adrian Voinea of Romania withdrew because of a sprained ankle . 
0000000003400000000003405000034050000000

Third seed Thomas Muster of Austria also charged into the second round with a 6-1 7-6 ( 7-2 ) 6-2 romp over Javier Frana of Argentina .

Michael Chang is playing in his 10th U.S. Open and enjoying his highest seeding ever , but the 24-year-old American had to overcome a case of the jitters Monday before winning his first-round match on opening day . 
34000007800000000007000000000000000000

Chang , seeded second behind defending champion Pete Sampras , took two hours 40 minutes to defeat 186th-ranked Jaime Oncins of Brazil 3-6 6-1 6-0 7-6 , 8-6 in the tiebreaker . 
30000003400000000034050000000000

" I was pretty tight the whole match , " conceded Chang , one of the hottest players on tour this summer with a 16-2 record on hardcourts that included two titles and a runner-up finish . 
0000000000030000000000000000000000000

" Everyone has moments when they get tight . 
000000000

Hopefully , this will have been my nerves for the whole tournament . " 
00000000000000

Joining Chang into the second round was Wimbledon runner-up MaliVai Washington , the 11th seed , who also needed four sets to get past talented Moroccan Karim Alami 6-4 2-6 7-6 ( 7-5 ) 6-1 . 
030000070340000000000000073400000000

Washington 's win was not comfortable , either . 
300000000

The 27-year-old American hurried off the Stadium Court for treatment of an upset stomach after his two and a half hour struggle against Alami . 
0070005600000000000000030

" Towards the end of my match my stomach felt like week-old sushi , " said Washington . " 
0000000000000000500

Maybe it was a combination of the heat and something I ate . " 
00000000000000

Chang and Washington were the only men 's seeds in action on a day that saw two seeded women 's players fall . 
30300000000000000000000

Australian Open runner-up Anke Huber of Germany , the sixth seed , was undone by an unlucky draw that put her against 17th ranked South African Amanda Coetzer in her opening match . 
780340500000000000000000783400000

Coetzer claimed revenge for the semifinal defeat she suffered to Huber in Melbourne by taking a 6-1 2-6 6-2 victory . 
300000000030500000000

Last year 's Wimbledon junior champion , Aleksandra Olsza of Poland , removed another seed from the draw by eliminating number 12 Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria 6-4 6-2 . 
00070003405000000000003405000

Other men 's winners included a pair of former Grand Slam tournament champions whose victories set up a showdown in the second round . 
000000000780000000000000

Germany 's Michael Stich , the 1991 Wimbledon champion , and two-time French Open winner Sergi Bruguera of Spain will face each other next after beating German Tommy Haas 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 , and Belgian Kris Goossens 6-2 6-0 7-6 ( 7-1 ) , respectively .

Chang blamed breezy conditions for some of the erratic play in his match with Oncins , who had beaten him in the round of 32 at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics . 
3000000000000030000000000000570

Chang committed an untidy 53 unforced errors , though he made seven fewer than the Brazilian , who also walloped a woeful 24 double faults . 
30000000000000070000000000

The most deflating double fault came when Oncins was serving to force a fifth set , leading 6-4 in the tiebreaker . 
0000000300000000000000

The set point came after confusion at the net on the point previous , which was awarded to Oncins after the two exchanged shots at close quarters at the net . 
0000000000000000003000000000000

First Chang approached the umpire , then Oncins , then Chang again before play finally resumed . 
03000003003000000

" Those little seconds were like an hour to me , " said Oncins , who promptly fired two serves barely contained by the baseline as he frittered away his best chance . 
000000000000030000000000000000000

Chang ran off the next three points to close out the match but for Oncins , the contest was a personal victory . 
30000000000000300000000

The 26-year-old Brazilian had risen into the top 30 in 1992 . 
007000000000

The next year a close friend was struck by a stray bullet while riding home in a car from a soccer game in Sao Paulo . 
00000000000000000000000560

He died slumped against Oncins , who subsequently lost interest in tennis . 
0000300000000

" Two months ago I started talking about quitting , " said Oncins , who decided to give it one last try and made it through the Open qualifying tournament last weekend . 
000000000000300000000000000700000

" I believe in my game again , " he said . 
000000000000

At the end of the day , a spate of withdrawals from the tournament were announced . 
00000000000000000

Eighth seed Jim Courier withdrew because of a bruised right knee , and 1988 Open champion Mats Wilander bowed out due to a groin pull , organisers said . 
00340000000000703400000000000

Women 's ninth seed Mary Joe Fernandez pulled out because of tendinitis in her right wrist .

PARIS 1996-08-27

Former European champions Marseille held French champions Auxerre to a goalless draw in a lacklustre league match on Tuesday . 
07010701000000000000

The bill looked promising but both sides , struggling to find their form early in the season , were disappointing . 
000000000000000000000

Auxerre , who start their European Cup campaign next week against Ajax Amsterdam , dominated the match but were unable to score . 
10000780000120000000000

Unbeaten in four matches , they still trail leaders Lens by one point . 
00000000010000

Lens , who have won all their three league matches so far , host Montpellier on Wednesday night . 
1000000000000010000

Despite another dismal performance , especially in defence , Marseille restored some pride by keeping the reigning champions at bay after losing 2-1 at home to Metz last Saturday . 
000000000100000000000000001000

After two seasons in the second division and after taking on half a dozen new recruits this season , some of whom do not speak a word of French , Marseille are not playing with any fluidity . 
00000000000000000000000000007010000000

But German international goalkeeper Andreas Koepke again proved a sound investment when under pressure from the Auxerre strikers , saving his team with a number of fine parries . 
07003400000000001000000000000

Marseille now lie seventh in the league on five points .

SOCCER - NEUCHATEL TO APPEAL AGAINST CYPRIEN 'S NINE-MONTH BAN . 
00100030000

GENEVA 1996-08-27 
50

Swiss league leaders Neuchatel Xamax said on Tuesday they would appeal against a nine-month ban imposed on French international defender Jean-Pierre Cyprien for his part in a post-match brawl . 
700120000000000007003400000000

Cyprien , also fined 10,000 Swiss francs ( $ 8,400 ) , traded punches with St Gallen 's Brazilian player Claudio Moura after a match on Saturday . 
3000070000000001207034000000

When officials and coaching staff tried to intervene , Cyprien launched a flying kick at Moura , but only succeeded in kneeing St Gallen coach Roger Hegi in the stomach . 
0000000003000003000000120340000

Moura , who appeared to have elbowed Cyprien in the final minutes of the 3-0 win by Neuchatel , was suspended for seven matches and fined 1,000 francs ( $ 840 ) by the Swiss league disciplinary committee . 
300000030000000001000000000000000070000

Club president Gilbert Facchinetti said he was astonished the committee had arrived at its decision so quickly and vowed the club would appeal . 
003400000000000000000000

Neuchatel coach Gilbert Gress described the incident as " shocking " , but said Moura was also to blame . 
10340000000000300000

" Moura physically and verbally provoked Cyprien during the match . 
03000030000

The referee could not have seen it or he would have punished him , " Gress said . 
000000000000000300

" During the scuffle , Moura threw the first punch . 
00000300000

Tomorrow , if someone punches me , I would not know how to react . " 
0000000000000000

Cyprien , who won his one French cap against Italy in February 1994 , cannot play in Switzerland or elsewhere until May next year .

CYCLING - BUGNO CLEARED OF DOPING . 
0030000

MILAN 1996-08-27

Veteran Italian Gianni Bugno has been cleared of doping after testing positive for high levels of testosterone during the Tour of Switzerland in June , the Italian cycling federation said on Tuesday . 
073400000000000000078800007000000

" He has been cleared . 
000000

The case is closed , " a spokesman said . 
0000000000

Bugno tested positive for the banned hormone after the fifth stage of the Tour , in which he finished third overall . 
3000000000000700000000

But the spokesman said subsequent tests in Cologne proved his body produced higher-than-average testosterone levels naturally . 
00000005000000000

Bugno , who won the Giro d'Italia in 1990 and two successive world titles , was banned for three months in 1994 after testing positive for the stimulant caffeine .

COFINEC SLIPS ON BUDAPEST BOURSE BUT FUTURE STRONG . 
100500000

Emese Bartha

BUDAPEST 1996-08-27

Expectations that Cofinec S.A. , the Hungarian bourse 's first foreign listing , will report a disappointing first half have depressed the stock below its issue price , but analysts expect a rebound in the long term . 
00120070000000000000000000000000000000

" The first half of the year is unlikely to be as strong as expected so the company will probably be unable to reach its annual plan in 1996 , " said Gabor Sitanyi , a London-based analyst for ING Barings . 
000000000000000000000000000000003400000120

The French-registered packaging materials company , which floated its shares in Hungary in July , for most of the past two weeks hovered below the 6,425 forints / Global Depositary Receipts price of its initial offering , which was oversubscribed . 
07000000000500000000000000000000000000000

The company , which asked for a two-week delay from the usual August 15 deadline for reporting first-half results , closed on Tuesday at 5,800 forints , down 300 . 
000000000000000000000000000000

" Cofinec 's first-half figures will be ... 
01000000

between one-third of two-fifths of its annual plan , " said Tamas Erdei , a Budapest-based analyst for ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett . 
0000000000034007001220

Analysts blame , at least partly , Hungary 's macroeconomic environment for the weaker figures for Cofinec which , operating in Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic , now generates about 55 to 60 percent of its annual sales from Hungary . 
0000000500000000100005050056000000000000050

Hungary 's Gross Domestic Product fell one percentage point in the first quarter while real wages plunged 7.2 percentage points in the first half of 1996 . 
500000000000000000000000000

Both will have their impact on Cofinec 's figures , the analysts said . 
00000010000000

Despite the current difficulties , however , analysts were convinced that Cofinec 's outlook was strong . 
00000000000100000

" The eastern European market offers good chances , " said Erdei . " 
00070000000300

Just like many other companies on the bourse , Cofinec has big growth opportunities . " 
0000000001000000

" At the same time , it 's an advantage for Cofinec that it has a foreign management which perhaps understands the market better , " Erdei added . 
00000000000100000000000000300

" Cofinec is a very good story in the long-term as the per capita packaging consumption is still so low in east Europe that a very strong increase can be expected ( long-term ) , " Sitanyi said , saying that several recent moves by Cofinec boosted its position . 
01000000000000000000005000000000000030000000010000

Among them , he noted that Cofinec had acquired the outstanding stake in its Czech folding company Krpaco a.s. , increasing its ownership to 100 percent , so in the second half the whole of Krpaco 's figures will be consolidated . 
000000100000007001200000000000000001000000

The company also repaid some $ 21 million of debt , well above the originally planned $ 8 million to $ 9 million . 
000000000000000000000000

In addition , its Polish operation began with some six weeks of delay due to cold winter weather and the test run was also longer than planned .

Ireland 's most experienced player , defender Paul McGrath , was left out of the national squad for the first time in 11 years on Tuesday when new manager Mick McCarthy named his side to face Liechtenstein in a World Cup qualifier . 
5000000340000000000000000000034000005007800

The 36-year-old Aston Villa player won the last of his Irish record of 82 international caps against the Czech Republic in Prague in April . 
0012000000700000005605000

" Paul accepted the situation .

He has n't played any first-team games for Villa this season and he 's not the type of player I would have brought on as a substitute , " McCarthy said . " 
000000003000000000000000000003000

But he surprised me in training over the last two days because of his involvement . 
0000000000000000

He 's certainly is still very much part of my plans for the future . 
000000000000000

" At 24 , 25 or 26 you could get away with it , not having played first-team games . 
00000000000000000000

But at 36 it would be asking too much of Paul , " he said . 
0000000000300000

Also omitted from the 20-man squad which will travel to Vaduz for Saturday 's group eight match are central defenders Alan Kernaghan and Liam Daish .

The main rebel group in south Sudan said on Tuesday it was trying to arrange the release of six Roman Catholic missionaries , including three Australian nuns , held for nearly two weeks . 
0000005000000000000780000700000000

George Garang , Nairobi spokesman for the Sudan People 's Liberation Army ( SPLA ) , said it was urgently trying to contact SPLA commander Nuour Marial at Mapourdit in the south to free the six . 
3405000122220100000000010340500000000

" The movement is making arrangements for them to be set free . 
0000000000000

This is a decision of the leadership , " Garang said . 
000000000300

" Commander Nuour Marial is a soldier so he must accept the leadership 's decision . 
0034000000000000

But communications at this time of year are very difficult because of rains and a lack of power , " he added . 
00000000000000000000000

The Catholic Information Office in Nairobi said on Monday that four of the six had been charged by the SPLA with spying , spreading Islam and hindering recruitment into the rebel group . 
012205000000000000010000700000000

" These charges are the interpretation of the church , " Garang said on Tuesday . " 
00000000000300000

We have no idea why they are being held . 
0000000000

We are still trying to establish contact with the local commander . " 
0000000000000

Asked whether this meant the commander was out of control , Garang said the rebel movement was working on the problem . 
0000000000030000000000

He said he believed all six were being held in the mission compound at Mapourdit and were reported to be in good health . 
000000000000005000000000

The Catholic Information office in Nairobi said on Monday that Australian Sisters Moira Lynch , 73 , and Mary Batchelor , 68 , American Father Michael Barton , 48 , and Sudanese Father Raphael Riel , 48 , were held in a prison in south Sudan by the SPLA . 
01220500007034000034000703400007034000000000050010

It said Australian Sister Maureen Carey , 52 , and Italian Brother Raniero Iacomella , 28 , were held inside the compound . 
00703400007034000000000

The church in Australia said on Monday Lynch , Batchelor , Barton and Riel were held in a prison until the weekend , when they were moved to join the other captives at the compound . 
000500030303050000000000000000000000

The Catholic Information Office said the SPLA in the Kenyan capital had attributed the detentions of the six to a local commander and had promised they would be freed by August 23 . 
012200100700000000000000000000000

But the church learned in a recent meeting with the local commander that no instructions to release the prisoners were received and they would be held until investigations were completed . 
0000000000000000000000000000000

It said last Friday they were visited by Monsignor Caesar Mazzolari , apostolic administrator of the diocese of Rumbek in southern Sudan , and an SPLA administrator and appeared in good condition . 
000000000340000000500500010000000

" On August 17 the mission was surrounded ( by the SPLA ) and sealed off . 
00000000000100000

The evening of the same day the missionaries were put in prison or isolation . 
000000000000000

Later the mission was looted , " it added . 
0000000000

An Australian foreign ministry official said the charges against them were " fairly bizarre " and a matter for concern . 
070000000000000000000

He said Australian diplomats in Nairobi were working with the Roman Catholic church in southern Sudan and with U.S. and Italian diplomats in the region to help free the missionaries .

The SPLA has fought Khartoum 's government forces in the south since 1983 for greater autonomy or independence of the mainly Christian and animist region from the Moslem , Arabised north .

OSCE postpones Bosnian municipal elections .

SARAJEVO 1996-08-27

The U.S. diplomat in charge of elections in Bosnia announced on Tuesday that voting for municipal assemblies would be postponed because of irregularities by the Serbs in registering voters . 
050000005000000000000000070000

Ambassador Robert Frowick , representing the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , told reporters that municipal polls due on September 14 with other Bosnian elections would be put off . 
03400012222220100000000000007000000

" I have made a chairman 's decision that it is not feasible to hold municipal elections on September 14 , " said Frowick . 
0000000000000000000000030

He said no exact date had been set but it was possible the local elections would take place in the spring of 1997 . 
000000000000000000000000

According to OSCE officials , Serb authorities have pressed their refugees to register to vote in towns now under Serb control , but which used to have Moslem majorities . 
001007000000000000070000000700

Human rights workers say authorities in Serbia and Bosnian Serb territory have conducted a well-organised campaign to coerce refugees into registering only on Serb territory and failed to inform them of their rights under the Dayton peace agreement . 
000000507800000000000007000000000005000

Diplomats say the effect of the electoral engineering would be to establish political control over districts they conquered and ethnically cleansed in war . 
000000000000000000000000

The response of the Bosnian Serbs to the OSCE 's announcement was not immediately clear . 
0000780010000000

But Bosnian Serb leaders have hinted they would boycott the poll if the municipal elections were postponed , or go ahead with their own . 
0780000000000000000000000

The Bosnian Serb cabinet , in a letter to the OSCE , said on Monday that any delay of local elections would be " a direct and flagrant violation fo the Dayton agreement " . 
07800000001000000000000000000005000

The Serbs , who administer half of Bosnia in a Serb republic , said they had met all conditions for holding the September elections . 
0700000500700000000000000

Diplomats fear that the crisis could cast doubt over the entire election process , which already appears set to confirm Bosnia 's ethnic partition rather than its reintegration as the Dayton peace agreement had planned .

New talks in Chechnya as Lebed waits for Yeltsin .

NOVYE ATAGI , Russia 1996-08-27 
56050

Russian and rebel military commanders finally met in Chechnya on Tuesday for delayed talks aimed at finalising a ceasefire arranged last week by President Boris Yeltsin 's envoy Alexander Lebed . 
7000000050000000000000003400340

The Russian army commander in the region , General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov , arrived at the rebel-held village of Novye Atagi , some 20 km ( 12 miles ) south of the Chechen capital Grozny for discussions with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov . 
070000000340000000560000000000070500000340

But Lebed himself , the Kremlin security chief , is still waiting back in Moscow to meet Yeltsin over his plans for a lasting political settlement in Chechnya . 
03000500000000500300000000050

Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Kremlin press service as saying Yeltsin , who left for a state holiday home near Moscow on Monday , would hold no working meetings on Tuesday . 
10000500003000000000500000000000

Lebed interrupted talks with Chechnya 's separatists on a political deal on Sunday , saying he had to consult with Yeltsin . 
3000500000000000000030

After a meeting failed to materialise on Monday , Lebed 's spokesman said he might meet the president on Tuesday . 
000000000300000000000

But Yeltsin 's spokesman rebuffed the suggestion , saying the president had left Moscow for a holiday near the capital . 
030000000000050000000

The Russians postponed the talks after a Chechen band disarmed a column of interior ministry troops on Sunday . 
0700000700000120000

The Chechens said a renegade group seized the weapons and said on Monday they had all been returned . 
0700000000000000000

The Russian command insisted that not all the weapons were the same as those taken . 
0700000000000000

Tass said the weapons and the practical implementation of the ceasefire signed by Lebed and Maskhadov last Thursday would be on the agenda of today 's talks . 
1000000000000303000000000000

Neither spoke to reporters before the meeting , which started around 10.45 a.m. ( 0645 GMT ) . 
000000000000000700

Also in Novye Atagi on Tuesday morning , was Tim Guldimann , the Swiss diplomat who heads the Chechnya mission of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 
005600000340070000500012222220100

Guldimann , who helped broker an earlier truce in May , was not taking part in the Tikhomirov-Maskhadov talks . 
30000000000000000700

Lebed 's peace mission this month has stopped some of the worst fighting of the 20-month-old conflict . 
300000000000000000

However , tension on the ground indicates that it could falter if the momentum for a settlement is not maintained . 
000000000000000000000

Three Russian servicemen were wounded in a total of six shooting incidents overnight , Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Russian military as saying on Tuesday morning . 
070000000000001000070000000

RIA news agency quoted an army source accusing rebel fighters of failing to turn up for joint Russian-Chechen police patrols in some districts of the capital Grozny on Tuesday . 
100000000000000007000000005000

But the separatist command told Interfax news agency the patrols , part of the truce brokered by Lebed last week , would begin on Tuesday after delays for " technical reasons " . 
000001000000000003000000000000000

Yeltsin 's spokesman said he might meet officials during his break , but indicated Lebed was low on the list by saying Yeltsin would need time to study the proposals before talking to him . 
30000000000000300000003000000000000

Russian news agencies also quoted the Kremlin spokesman as saying that Lebed 's representatives had not sought a meeting , hinting at an attempt by the president to put his popular and outspoken protege in his place with a lesson on protocol . 
7000005000030000000000000000000000000000000

Yeltsin , 65 , has kept a low profile since he was reelected in July , prompting new speculation that the two heart attacks he suffered last year and a rumoured drinking problem could be taking their toll , weakening his grip on affairs of state . 
30000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Aides have dismissed such speculation , insisting that he simply needs a rest after his energetic election campaign . 
0000000000000000000

Some analysts say the Kremlin leader , whose order sending troops and tanks into Chechnya in 1994 started Russia 's ill-fated military campaign , could merely be reluctant to put his name to a peace process which might fall apart . 
00005000000000500050000000000000000000000

But Lebed , who has no real power without his boss and has hinted at dark forces in Moscow working against him , appears to think a deal will not stick without strong backing from Yeltsin . 
0300000000000000005000000000000000030

His proposals have not been spelled out but are expected to involve a compromise between the separatists ' demand for independence and Moscow 's insistence that Chechnya remain part of the Russian Federation .

Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski and his Slovenian counterpart , Milan Kucan , met for talks at the start of a two-day visit to Slovenia by Kwasniewski . 
703400700340000000000005030

It was their fourth meeting this year . 
00000000

They said in a statement they agreed to have regular telephone contact to discuss progress in strengthening ties with the West . 
0000000000000000000050

" We expect our cooperation will help both countries towards entering the European Union and NATO , " Kwasniewski said . 
000000000000120100300

" We have similar ambitions as far as our internal development and international life is concerned , " Kucan said . 
000000000000000000300

Poland and Slovenia are hoping to be among the first group of former eastern bloc countries to join the European Union and NATO . 
505000000000000000012010

They have already signed an association agreement with the European Union and are both part of the Central European Free Trade Area , which also comprises Hungary , Slovakia and the Czech Republic .

Nationalists want Iliescu ousted for Hungary pact . 
00300500

BUCHAREST 1996-08-27 
50

Junior Nationalist members of Romania 's ruling coalition called on Tuesday for the impeachment of President Ion Iliescu for backing a friendship treaty with neighbouring Hungary . 
000050000000000034000000050

Iliescu 's Party of Social Democracy , the senior coalition partner , immediately dismissed the National Unity Party ( PUNR ) demand as crude electioneering . 
30122200000000012201000000

" It is a desperate move by the PUNR , which is losing its only reason for existing ahead of the electoral campaign , " said PDSR executive president Adrian Nastase . 
00000000100000000000000000100340

" This treaty is both necessary and good , " Nastase said , adding that the PUNR 's stance was threatening its position in the government . 
000000000030000010000000000

The treaty agreed unexpectedly two weeks ago will end years of disputes over the status of Romania 's large ethnic Hungarian minority . 
00000000000000005000700

It will also boost both countries ' chances of admission to NATO and the European Union . 
00000000000100120

" If they ( the PUNR ) are so vexed , they could leave the government ... 
00000100000000000

We might also help them to do it , if they go on like this , " he said . 
00000000000000000000

The PUNR holds four key ministries -- justice , transport , agriculture and communications . 
010000000000000

PUNR leader Gheorghe Funar said in a statement Iliescu , in power since the fall of communism in 1989 , should be impeached for treason for compromising on the issue of ethnic Hungarian minority rights in the treaty due to be signed next month . 
103400003000000000000000000000007000000000000

Funar 's call came on the eve of the official launch of Iliescu 's campaign for a new term at November 3 polls . 
300000000000300000000000

His appeal to the opposition to back his attempt to oust Iliescu was unlikely to succeed , analysts said . 
00000000000300000000

Iliescu has invited political leaders to a meeting on Thursday to discuss the final form of the pact which both Romanian and Hungarian nationalists oppose for different reasons . 
30000000000000000000707000000

Presidential officials were not available to comment on the call for Iliescu 's impeachment .

Estonia 's parliament failed for a second time to elect a president on Tuesday , dealing a blow to incumbent Lennart Meri and pushing the country towards stalemate in its choice of a new head of state . 
50000000000000000000340000000000000000

Neither Meri , who oversaw Estonia 's first steps into statehood after the collapse of the Soviet Union , nor his arch-rival , former communist Arnold Ruutel , have secured the 68 votes necessary from the 101-member parliament . 
030005000000000056000000034000000000000

Meri garnered 49 votes and Meri 34 in Tuesday 's ballot for the five-year presidency of Estonia . 
300003000000000050

A third and final vote was due to be held when parliament reconvened on Tuesday but legislators were not expecting a clear result . 
000000000000000000000000

If there is no result the decision will be ceded to an electoral college . 
000000000000000

" The votes are a strong message to Meri that he is not favoured by some politicians any more , " Reform Party head Heiki Kranich told Reuters . 
00000000300000000000012034010

Under a constitution agreed in 1992 , a year after independence , the president has no executive powers . 
0000000000000000000

His only political role is to smoothe the functioning of government in periods of crisis . 
0000000000000000

But Meri , 67 , has been accused in parliament of taking too much power and not always consulting parliamentarians before making decisions . 
030000000000000000000000

His relations with a leftist-led government have sometimes been tense . 
00000000000

His support in the first round of voting on Monday was much lower than expected , scoring only 45 votes , which political analysts put down as a vote of no confidence in his performance . 
000000000000000000000000000000000000

This support only inched up to 49 in the second vote . 
000000000000

Parliamentary organisers said the exact timetable remained unclear but it would probably take about a month to organise an electoral college which could also hold several rounds of voting before a clear winner emerges .

Albanian authorities have arrested and charged a British man for sexually abusing two young boys , a Tirana prosecutor said on Tuesday .

" We have arrested him and charged him with these shameful acts of sex abuse of little children , " prosecutor Adnan Xhelili told Reuters . 
00000000000000000000034010

He could face up to five years in jail if convicted .

Estonia 's parliament again failed to elect a new state president on Tuesday when neither of two candidates secured a majority in second-round voting . 
5000000000000000000000000

Incumbent president Lennart Meri won 49 votes compared to 34 won by his rival , deputy Parliamentary Speaker Arnold Ruutel . 
003400000000000000340

But Meri 's support was not enough for the 68 needed for election and a third secret ballot will take place later in the day ( 1300 GMT ) , parliamentary officials said . 
0300000000000000000000000007000000

To win a clear mandate for the five-year presidential term , a candidate must secure 68 votes from the 101-member parliament . 
0000000000000000000000

Enn Markvart , Chairman of the National Election Commission , said 96 members of parliament voted in the second round , with 12 abstentions and one ballot paper invalid . 
340000122000000000000000000000

On Monday , in the first round of voting , Meri secured 45 votes and Ruutel 34 . 
000000000030000300

Meri 's popularity has suffered in recent years , with politicians criticising him for taking too much power and acting without consulting parliament . 
300000000000000000000000

If a third round of voting fails to give either candidate 68 votes , the parliamentary speaker has to convene an electoral college of all 101 MPs and 273 local government representatives for a new vote that could take up to a month .

Marc Dutroux , the chief accused in Belgium 's sensational child murder and sex abuse case , visited Slovakia a number of times and about 10 young Slovak women went to Belgium at his invitation , police said on Tuesday . 
34000005000000000050000000070005000000000

But they have difficulty remembering what happened there , perhaps because of drugs , and are unsure whether they were filmed for pornography , Rudolf Gajdos , head of the Slovak office of Interpol , told Reuters . 
00000000000000000000000034000070010010

Although Gajdos spoke of " girls " his deputy , Eva Boudova , said the case involved about 10 young women in their early 20s . 
03000000003400000000000000

" The police interrogated several Slovak girls who said that they had been invited by Mark Dutroux to visit Belgium , " Gajdos said . 
0000070000000003400500300

" The girls said they went to Belgium voluntarily and the police suspect that they were used to act in pornographic films . " 
000000050000000000000000

" The police suspect ( the girls ) were under the influence of drugs as some girls admitted they took unspecified pills . " 
000000000000000000000000

" We have suspicions of a rape , but the police still have to find the victim , " Gajdos added . 
0000000000000000000300

Dutroux 's last visit to Slovakia was reported to have been as recent as July .

Slovak police are also cooperating with Belgium in the search for An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks , who went missing last August . 
70000050000340340000000

Dutroux , 39 , who was charged last week with the abduction and illegal imprisonment of two other girls aged 14 and 12 , is one of several suspects in the Marchal and Lambrecks case . 
300000000000000000000000000000030300

Last Saturday he led police to the bodies of two other girls , aged eight , who died of starvation this year after their abduction in June , 1995 . 
000000000000000000000000000000

The Netherlands government has ruled out paying ransom money for a Dutch couple kidnapped from their farm , while Costa Rican authorities said on Tuesday they had no leads in the case . 
560000000007000000078000000000000

" We have not had contact with the kidnappers nor do we have any leads to take us to where they might be held , " Chief of Judicial Police Manuel Alvarado told Reuters . 
00000000000000000000000000001234010

Hurte Sierd Zylstra and his wife , Jetsi Hendrika Coers , both 50 , were abducted from the teak plantation they managed late Saturday or early Sunday by at least two men demanding $ 1.5 million ransom , authorities said . 
34400003440000000000000000000000000000000

Costa Rican officials on Monday had given different names for the couple .

Anton Schutte , an official with the embassy for Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg , said the Dutch government had ruled out paying any money in ransom . " 
340000000500505000700000000000

We 're looking at a criminal act that has no political aspect as far as what we can tell , " Schutte added .

00000000000000000000030000000

He said the note , believed to have been hand-written in Spanish and signed by the victims , was addressed to Ebe Huizinga , another Dutch citizen who owns the tree plantation . "

A swell of protest is growing within Venezuela 's trade unions at the proposed year-end privatization of the state-owned holding company Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana ( CVG ) , CVG union leaders said Tuesday . 
00000005000000000000012220100100000

" We do n't believe the government will make its timetable , " he added .

The CVG 's aluminum companies Venalum and Alucasa are also scheduled to be sold early 1997 .

001000000000000000001000000000000000000

" We oppose any privatization that hurts workers ' welfare and does not take into account its social impact , " they said .

Heavy drinkers in a Nicaraguan city were searching for someone who has covered them in " lovebites " while they were passed out in a drunken stupor , a local newspaper reported on Tuesday . 
00007000000000000000000000000000000

The dreaded " chupabolos " -- " drunksucker " -- preys on men who have passed out in the streets of Matagalpa , 80 miles ( 130 kms ) north of Managua , placing hickey-like " lovebites " on various parts of their bodies , El Nuevo Diario reported . 
00000000000000000000050000000005000000000000012200

Enraged drunks and street people in this town known for its machismo have organised a so-far unsuccessful search for the culprit who finds victims in the dark streets surrounding a local market . 
000000000000000000000000000000000

The total number of victims was still unknown . 
000000000

The first of the victims were two vagrants who slept in an abandoned car in front of a local bank , the newspaper said . 
0000000000000000000000000

In spite of the collective fear gripping Matagalpa 's drinkers , local women expressed little sympathy .

" Its just desserts for all the ' bolos ' ( drunkards ) who sleep in the streets of our beautiful town , " said a woman who worked in the local market .

Brazil likely to turn Banespa federal bank - paper .

SAO PAULO 1996-08-27

Brazil is likely to turn Sao Paulo state bank Banespa into a federal bank in a prior step to privatization , according to unnamed government sources , O Globo daily said . 
50000560010000000000000000012000

The newspaper said the Central Bank special administration of Banespa ends in December 30 and after that the bank has to be liquidated or turned into a federal bank since there are no conditions to return Banespa to Sao Paulo state government . 
0000120001000000000000000000000000001056000

A Central Bank spokesman said he could not confirm or deny the report . 
01200000000000

Banespa has been under central bank special temporary administration since December 1994 . 
1000000000000

The central bank management could be lifted if Sao Paulo state decided to take part in the recent federal government 's plan to restructure state banks . 
000000005600000000000000000

Under the plan , the federal government would provide 100 percent of the financing needed to restructure debt of state banks being privatized , liquidated or turned into development banks . 
0000000000000000000000000000000

It also offers to refinance up to 50 percent of the debt held by state banks whose governments decide to keep control of their banks . 
00000000000000000000000000

Although the plan was designed under terms proposed by Sao Paulo state governor Mario Covas , he has showed no interest in taking part in the plan because Sao Paulo 's debt with Banespa has increased sharply , O Globo said . 
000000000560034000000000000056000100001200

Sao Paulo state 's debt is now estimated at 19 billion reais . 
5600000000000

O Globo also said another delicate case to be solved involves private bank Bamerindus . 
120000000000010

The newspaper said Bamerindus has sent to the Central Bank a proposal for restructuring combined with a request for a 90-day credit line , paying four percent a year plus the Basic Interest Rate of the Central Bank ( TBC ) . 
000100001200000000000000000000000000120100

O Globo also said the loan would give Bamerindus time to sell assets . 
12000000100000

Bamerindus , Brazil 's fourth-largest private bank , has been facing liquidity troubles .

Former Argentine benevolent dictator Alejandro Lanusse dies . 
07003400

BUENOS AIRES 1996-08-26

Alejandro Lanusse , the former dictator who ruled Argentina for two years , died at age 78 on Monday . 
34000000500000000000

Lanusse died after being brought to a hospital a week ago following a fall at home that resulted in a blood clot in the brain . 
30000000000000000000000000

He was operated on earlier in the week but failed to recover from surgery . 
000000000000000

The former dictator , who ruled from 1971 to 1973 , was best known for allowing Juan Domingo Peron , Argentina 's famed populist leader , to return to Argentina after 17 years of forced exile . 
0000000000000000344050000000050000000

Lanusse took over the leadership of the country after five years of dictatorship . 
30000000000000

But unlike his two predecessors , Juan Carlos Ongania and Marcelo Levingston , who ruled Argentina with an iron hand , Lanusse steered the country toward democracy . 
0000003400340005000003000000

That resulted in general elections in March 1973 when the Peronists led by Hector Campora and Vicente Solano Lima returned to power . 
00000000001003403440000

Lanusse was a candidate in the election but failed to defeat his old adversories and never returned to public office . 
300000000000000000000

He was imprisoned for four years in 1951 for taking part in a coup attempt to overthrow Peron led by General Benjamin Menendez . 
000000000000000003000340

A small number of Bosnians had also begun to vote in Turkey .

He will leave on Thursday .

A new U.N. relief coordinator has arrived in Baghdad to take up the task of organising humanitarian goods distribution and to face Iraq 's continuing opposition over the number of international monitors to be involved . 
001000005000000000000050000000000000

U.N. and diplomatic sources said on Tuesday that Secretary- General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had appointed Italian Gualtiero Fulcheri and sent him to Iraq last week to replace Moroccan Mohamed Zejjari . 
100000000034007340000500007340

One diplomat said Iraq and U.N. were still in disagreement on how many international observers would be required to ascertain the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies that will be procured under Baghdad 's oil deal with U.N . 
00050100000000000000000000000005000000

" The United Nations would like to employ hundreds of foreign monitors . 
0012000000000

Baghdad says it can only accept a few dozens , " said the diplomat . 
500000000000000

Baghdad holds that the Iraq-U.N. memorandum of understanding on partial oil sales signed last June does not specify how many foreign observers should be stationed in Iraq . 
5000700000000000000000000050

" Observation of food supplies and their distribution are still a major issue and seems the two sides have not yet filled the gap separating them , " said another diplomat . 
00000000000000000000000000000000

Iraq 's partial oil sales pact with U.N. , allowing crude exports worth $ 2 billion every six months , gives U.N. the right to supervise the purchase and distribution of food supplies in the country . 
5000000100000000000001000000000000000

The deal is a humanitarian exception to the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990 which include a ban on its oil exports . 
000000001000500500000000000

Fulcheri declined comment on the differences between the U.N. and Iraq , saying only : " There are several different things which still need to be done . " 
30000000105000000000000000000

Fulcheri started his U.N. career in 1960 and has long experience in U.N. emergency relief in Congo , Angola , Sudan and Somalia .

An anti-abortion politician addressed the Democratic convention on Tuesday , but praised the overwhelmingly pro-abortion rights party for its tolerance of his minority views .

Rep .

Tony Hall of Ohio said he and other Democrats who opposed abortion had always felt left out in their own party . 
3405000070000000000000

" But this year is different . 
0000000

For the first time , the Democratic Party has included in our platform a conscience clause , " he said . 
000000120000000000000

The clause recognizes and welcomes Democrats with divergent views on abortion and states they have a full part to play at all levels of the party . 
000007000000000000000000000

" The Democratic Party is indeed the party of true inclusiveness , " Hall said .

At its convention four years ago , organizers prevented then Pennsylvania Gov . 
0000000000500

Robert Casey , a vehement opponent of abortion , from speaking . 
340000000000

Republicans have used their decision as an example of Democrat intolerance ever since . 
70000000070000

Casey told a news conference in Chicago on Tuesday he had asked to speak again this year but was turned down . 
3000005000000000000000

Democratic leaders said there was not room on the program for every retired governor to speak . 
70000000000000000

" I believe the Democratic party ought to be pro-woman , pro-child and pro-life , " Casey said . 
0000700000000000300

" I asked for the opportunity to deliver this message from the podium of the Democrat National Convention . 
0000000000000001220

For the second time in four years , my request fell on deaf ears , " he said . 
0000000000000000000

340000000000000

Bob Dole , the Republican presidential nominee , tried and failed to insert a tolerance clause in his party 's platform recognizing the validity of those within the party who supported abortion rights . 
3400700000000000000000000000000000

Democrats also heard Tuesday two passionate speeches defending abortion rights . 
70000000000

Kate Michelman , president of the National Abortion Rights Action League , described how she had an abortion at a time when the procedure was illegal after her husband abandoned her with three young children . 
340000122220000000000000000000000000

" I 'm here to speak up for choice and to speak for truth . 
000000000000000

The message from the Republican Party is one of disdain . 
00001200000

Their answer to choice is control and punishment . 
000000000

Our answer is trust , compassion and respect , " she said .

Dark northern spring and white wheat bids were mostly steady on Tuesday but a few locations quoted weaker values as newly harvested spring wheat flooded the market , several cash grain dealers said .

" There 's too much nearby wheat coming into the market so we 're backing off the basis to slow it down , " a Montana dealer said .

An ABC News poll released on Tuesday showed President Bill Clinton 's lead over Republican challenger Bob Dole stretching to 15 points in advance of the Nov. 5 election . 
012000000340007034000000000000

The poll , taken on Sunday and Monday as the president engaged in a whistle-stop train trip to the Democratic Convention in Chicago , put Clinton at 51 percent , Dole at 36 percent and Ross Perot of the Reform Party at 8 percent . 
000000000000000000078050030000300003400120000

A similar poll conducted on Saturday and Sunday had showed a nine point lead for Clinton , ahead by 47-38 percent . 
0000000000000003000000

Dole , down by around 20 points in early August in ABC polls , had closed to within four percentage points immediately after the Republican convention in San Diego earlier in August .

Other polls also showed a strong Dole bounce after San Diego but Clinton then rebuilding his lead .

High-priced corn and increased demand for livestock feed continued to support millfeed prices in nearly all sectors .

A two-year old Puerto Rican girl began surgical treatment on Tuesday for a rare condition that has left half of her face covered with a hairy , dark-brown patch of skin . 
00078000000000000000000000000000

The girl , Abyss DeJesus , suffers from a " hairy nevus " on the right side of her face , a condition that has only been reported a few times in medical journals , the St. Christopher Children 's Hospital said . 
0003400000000000000000000000000000005666600

In addition to social ostracism , the condition also carries a high risk of cancer . 
0000000000000000

It will be corrected by gradually expanding healthy skin with a surgical balloon , then transplanting that skin to the afflicted side of her face . 
00000000000000000000000000

" She is doing well , " hospital spokeswoman Carol Norris said . " 
00000000034000

The surgery is under way . " 
0000000

Norris said Tuesday 's surgery involved placing five balloons in DeJesus 's forehead , shoulders and the back of her neck and partially filling them with a saline solution . 
300000000030000000000000000000

More saline solution will be inserted in 16 weekly treatments . 
00000000000

The girl , who was accompanied to Philadelphia by her parents , will need more surgery later to correct the condition on her chest , back and legs , the hospital said .

Doctors said that later in the day they would try to wean the Nobel Peace Prize laureate from the respirator that has aided her breathing for the past six days . 
0000000000000788000000000000000

" Her condition seems to be better , but the danger remains as long as she is on respirator , " an official at Woodlands Nursing Home said . " 
000000000000000000000000566000

She is conscious but her breathing is irregular . "

The revered Roman Catholic nun was admitted to the Calcutta hospital a week ago with high fever and severe vomiting .

She later suffered heart failure and was diagnosed with malaria . 
00000000000

Her fever has since abated and the heart failure has been brought under control , but her heart continues to beat irregularly , doctors said . 
00000000000000000000000000

" Unless she breathes on her own , I would advise you to keep your fingers crossed , " said a doctor who was familiar with her case but not part of the six-member team treating Mother Teresa . 
000000000000000000000000000000000000340

British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on Tuesday that his government would only take action against a planned conference of Islamist groups in London if British law was broken . 
700340000000000000007005070000

" People who wish to hold conferences of course do n't need to seek permission from the government in Britain , " Rifkind , in Pakistan for a visit , told Reuters . " 
0000000000000000000500300500000100

As long as they obey our laws then that is not something the government would normally interfere with . " 
00000000000000000000

The Islamist conference , due to be held in London on September 8 , has caused concern in countries such as Algeria and Egypt , which are fighting armed Islamic militants . 
07000000050000000000050500000700

British Jewish groups have also protested because they say members of Algeria 's Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) and the Palestinian Islamic group Hamas are on the guest list . 
7700000000050122010007701000000

Rifkind said it was for the home secretary ( interior minister ) to act by denying visas to participants if he felt there was reason to believe that they might break the law . 
3000000000000000000000000000000000

" Our policy has to be fundamentally based on respect for the rule of law and insistence that it be observed , " he said .

A spokesman for Masood said he had told the California Republican at a meeting in northern Kabul that President Burhanuddin Rabbani 's government favoured talks with all Afghan factions to set up an interim government . 
000300000570000050034000000700000000

The factions should agree to appoint a transitional leader , draft a new constitution , collect heavy weapons , create a national army and hold free elections in which the transitional leader would be barred from standing , he added . 
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Rohrabacher flew into Bagram military airbase north of Kabul in a Red Cross plane on Tuesday after meeting northern opposition militia leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum . 
300500005001200000000003440

Masood 's spokesman Amrollah ( one name ) said Rohrabacher had recently visited Italy , Saudi Arabia and Pakistan as part of a mission to promote peace in Afghanistan . 
300300000300050560500000000050

" We are certainly serious more than before to find a solution to the Afghan problem and support every U.N. plan , " Amrollah quoted Rohrabacher as saying . 
00000000000000700001000303000

However , a spokesman for Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , a long-time rival of Masood , expressed concern at signs of renewed U.S. interest in Afghanistan . 
000000034000003000000050050

" America wants to block the establishment of a strong Islamic government in Afghanistan and the U.S. intends to neutralise the Afghan peace process initiated by the Afghans themselves , " said the spokesman , Hamid Ibrahimi . 
05000000007005005000070000070000000340

" A great game has been started in Afghanistan as America feels that Tehran and Moscow have got stronger in the Afghan picture -- something Washington wants to change , " he said . 
0000000050500505000007000500000000

Rohrabacher was expected to visit neutral faction leaders in the eastern city of Jalalabad and meet leaders of the rebel Islamic Taleban militia in the southern city of Kandahar .

0005000344000000000000000000000

He told the Bengali newspaper Banglabazar Patrika on Tuesday that such threats were possibly coming from " those who want to push the country into chaos and unrest . " 
000701200000000000000000000000

The callers said his life could be cut short , the newspaper said . 
00000000000000

The speaker was not immediately available for comment . 
000000000

000344000000000001220100000000000000000

" The ruling Awami league is making parliament ineffective and the speaker is contributing to that by not allowing the opposition MPs enough time to speak , " she told a rally in northern district of Bogra on Monday . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000005000

Hasina , speaking to a group of engineers in Dhaka on Monday , accused the BNP of resorting to " terrorism " as part of its plan to create instability and chaos in the country . 
300000000500000100000000000000000000

" This is not desireable ...

We now have the opportunity to realize the potential of Arequipa 's excellent assets , " Barrick chairman and chief executive Peter Munk said in a statement . 
0000000000100000100003400000

The C$ 30-a-share deal means Barrick will own Arequipa 's attractive Pierina gold deposit in Peru .

Barrick said details involving the allocation between Barrick shares and cash will be available shortly . 
1000000100000000

1000700000000000100000007000

Toronto-based Barrick , the world 's third largest gold producer , sweetened its July 11 bid to C$ 30 a share from C$ 27 on August 16 after a fresh batch of drill results from the Pierina deposit . 
710000000000000007000070000000000000500

Experts have speculated the deposit has potential reserves of up to 12 million ounces . 
000000000000000

More drilling results are expected soon .

Sarah Brady , whose Republican husband was severely disabled in an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan , took centre stage at the Democratic National convention on Monday night to praise President Bill Clinton 's gun control efforts . 
340070000000000340000007880000003400000

With her husband James sitting in a wheelchair to the side of the podium , Mrs. Brady called the handgun control bill that a Democratic Congress passed and Clinton signed in 1994 a major step in controlling firearm violence in the United States . 
00030000000000003000000071003000000000000560

But she said more had to be done . 
000000000

The Bradys walked on to the stage , he on her arm and with the aid of a cane , to a rousing reception from the convention . 
0300000000000000000000000000

Their teenaged son sat in a VIP box with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and watched as his father returned to his wheelchair . 
000000000003440000000000

" Jim , we must have made a wrong turn . 
03000000000

This is n't San Diego ( site of the Republican convention ) , " Mrs. Brady joked to her husband , who was serving as Reagan 's press secretary when he was shot . 
0005600007000003000000000300000000

" Sarah , I told you this is the Democratic convention , " he responded to his wife , who before the shooting had worked for two Republican congressmen and the Republican national party . 
03000000070000000000000000070007000

" Since the Brady Law went into effect on February 28 , 1994 ( it ) has stopped more than 100,000 convicted felons and other prohibited purchasers from buying a handgun . 
00078000000000000000000000000000

Today , and every day , the Brady Law is stopping an estimated 85 felons from buying a handgun , " Mrs. Brady said . 
0000000780000000000000300

She added , " But we need to do more . 
00000000000

We should , as President Clinton proposed today , stop people convicted of domestic violence from buying a handgun . 
00000300000000000000

Jim and I join with you tonight in saluting the great job that President Clinton has done in fighting crime and gun violence . " 
3000000000000030000000000

" He 's a hunter and a sportsman , but he understands the difference between a Remington rifle and an AK47 . 
0000000000000000700070

And he knows that you do n't go hunting with an Uzi . 
0000000000070

Mr. President you deserve our thanks . " 
00000000

Jim Brady then gave a big thumbs to the audience .

was shot in the head in 1981 by gunman John Hinckley , who tried to kill Reagan in a deranged bid to impress Jodie Foster , an actress he never met but with whom he was obsessed . 
00000000034000003000000340000000000000

The Brady bill , calling for a waiting period before someone could buy a gun so a background check could be made , was first introduced in Congress in 1987 but it took seven years to pass because of opposition from the National Rifle Association gun lobby .

Armed hijackers believed to be Iraqis released 140 people on Tuesday from a Sudan Airways plane carrying 199 passengers and crew that landed in London after being diverted on a flight from Khartoum to Amman , police said . 
000007000000012000000000500000005050000

Police spokesman Roger Grimwade said the six or seven hijackers remained on board the aircraft , which arrived from Cyprus at 4.30 a.m. ( 0330 GMT ) . 
0034000000000000000500000700

He said they had made various requests to police negotiators but stepped back from earlier suggestions that the hijackers had asked to speak to a British-based Iraqi police named as Mr Sadiki . 
000000000000000000000000077000030

The hijackers , who have said they want to seek asylum in Britain , are believed to be armed with grenades and possibly other explosives , according to police . 
000000000000500000000000000000

They earlier threatened to blow up the aircraft .

Hijacked Sudan plane lands at a London airport . 
050000500

STANSTED , England 1996-08-27 
5050

A hijacked Sudan Airways plane carrying 199 passengers and crew landed at Stansted airport just outside London early on Tuesday morning after flying from Cyprus , eyewitnesses said . 
00120000000050005000000050000

The Airbus 310 Flight 150 , which was hijacked on Monday evening on its way from Khartoum to the Jordanian capital Amman , landed at 4.30 a.m. ( 0330 GMT ) after a flight of more than four hours . 
0787800000000000500705000000070000000000

At least one of the unidentified hijackers was apparently armed with grenades and TNT and threatened to blow the plane up in Cyprus unless it was refuelled so they could fly to Britain to claim political asylum . 
00000000000000000000005000000000500000

" They will surrender the passengers there and surrender themselves , " police spokesman Glafcos Xenos told reporters at Cyprus 's Larnaca airport . 
000000000000003400050500

Security was tight at Stansted airport , which is about 30 miles ( 50 km ) northeast of the capital . 
000050000000000000000

Stansted has been designated as the preferred option for handling hijackings in southern England because it is more remote than Heathrow and Gatwick , London 's two major airports , and handles less air traffic .

Hijacked Sudan plane expected at London 's Stansted . 
050005050

LONDON 1996-08-27 
50

A hijacked Sudan Airways plane with 199 passengers and crew on board was expected to land at London 's Stansted airport later on Tuesday morning , a police spokeswoman said . 
0012000000000000050500000000000

" That is the plan at the moment . 
000000000

That is where the plane is being directed to , " Ruth Collin of Essex police , the force responsible for Stansted , said . 
0000000000034050000005000

Stansted , London 's third-busiest airport after Heathrow and Gatwick , is located about 30 miles ( 48 km ) northeast of the capital . 
5050000505000000000000000

British officials said they would much prefer to deal with a hijacking at Stansted because of its relatively remote location and because air traffic would be less badly disrupted there than at Heathrow or Gatwick . 
700000000000050000000000000000005050

They said police and the emergency services were implementing a well-rehearsed contingency plan to handle the hijacking . 
000000000000000000

The armed hijackers of the Airbus 310 Flight 150 , which is expected to arrive about 4 a.m. ( 0300 GMT ) , have said they intend to surrender and seek political asylum in Britain . 
000007878000000000007000000000000050

The plane was hijacked on its way from Khartoum to the Jordanian capital Amman on Monday evening and landed at Larnaca airport in Cyprus to refuel . 
000000005007050000005005000

The identity and number of the hijackers was not known . 
00000000000

One of them negotiated through the pilot in English . 
0000000070

The pilot said several hijackers appeared to be placed around the plane .

Painted parrot scam lands Australian in jail . 
00007000

PERTH , Australia 1996-08-27 
5050

A conman who painted common Australian parrots with dye to make them look like rare birds worth thousands of dollars was jailed for fraud on Tuesday . 
000007000000000000000000000

Denham Peiris painted six green parrots , worth about A$ 100 ( US$ 79 ) a pair , with a cinnamon hair dye and traded them as Indian Ringneck Parrots , valued at A$ 14,000 a pair . 
34000000070070000000000000078800070000

Peiris , 32 , of Perth , was sentenced in the Western Australian District Court to two years in jail for fraud after trading three pairs of impostor birds for 21 parrots worth a total of A$ 28,000 . 
300005000007800000000000000000000000700

" Everyone was fooled , " said pet shop owner Shane Drew , who unknowingly traded the disguised birds . 
00000000003400000000

" I 'd already had three local breeders have a look at them and sent photos and videos of the birds to the eastern states for authentication -- they said they 're nice birds , " Drew told reporters outside court . 
000000000000000000000000000000000000300000

" After I was told they were dyed , I checked them over again . 
000000000000000

It was a perfect paint job except for one feather under a wing of one bird that was only half dyed , " Drew said . 
00000000000000000000000300

Drew said Peiris , a bird enthusiast , would have succeeded with the fraud if he had not tried to trade a fourth pair of bogus birds after an associate had told police of the scam . 
3030000000000000000000000000000000000

If not for the informant , the painted parrots ' true colours would not have been known for six months , he said . 
000000000000000000000000

" They moult in the summer , so five or six months down the track , I would have looked like the guilty party , " Drew said .

Seoul embassies warned of terrorist attacks . 
5000000

SEOUL 1996-08-27 
50

South Korea has told its overseas missions to step up security since its embassy in the former Yugoslavia received a threat over Seoul 's crackdown on radical students , the foreign ministry said on Tuesday . 
560000000000000005000050000000000000

A letter to the Belgrade embassy on Monday under the name of the Macedonian Communist Party demanded South Korea release detained student leaders , a ministry spokesman said . 
00005000000001220560000000000

" The letter said the party would assault the embassy , other South Korean-related facilities and Korean nationals unless our authorities released arrested students , " he said . 
00000000000078007000000000000

Nearly 400 members of an outlawed student group were arrested after violent protests demanding reunification with communist North Korea were crushed by riot police at a Seoul university this month . 
0000000000000000056000000050000

Authorities branded the violence , in which a police officer was killed , as an act of terror . 
0000000000000000000

" The ministry has ordered the embassy to take urgent security measures against possible terrorist attacks , " the official said , asking not to be named . 
0000000000000000000000000000

It had called for similar precautions at other overseas missions , including those in Canada and Bangladesh where leftist groups have staged protests over the crackdown .

Nuclear pact will be a step to disarmament-China . 
000000070

BEIJING 1996-08-27 
50

China on Tuesday reaffirmed its support for a global nuclear test ban treaty blocked by India last week , saying the pact would be an important step in achieving total nuclear disarmament . 
500000000000000500000000000000000

" Although the final draft of the treaty probably did n't totally satisfy any country , it was in general balanced , " the official People 's Daily newspaper said in a commentary . 
0000000000000000000000000122000000

India blocked the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva , saying the pact did not contain a clause committing the five declared nuclear powers to a timetable for nuclear disarmament . 
500788807000788050000000000000000000000

New Delhi 's stance , which was seen as effectively thwarting 2-1/2 years of negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament , drew widespread but generally muted foreign criticism . 
56000000000000000788000000000

India has also pledged to oppose any forwarding of the draft treaty to the United Nations General Assembly . 
5000000000000012220

China said many countries had compromised to complete the treaty and that the issue of a disarmament schedule could be discussed in future negotiations . 
5000000000000000000000000

" The completion of the test ban treaty would be an important and practical step in the gradual process of achieving total nuclear disarmament , " it said . 
00000000000000000000000000000

China has pledged support for the pact since reaching a deal with the United States that made international inspections of nuclear sites more difficult than in earlier drafts of the accord . 
50000000000005600000000000000000

The newspaper said China advocated the complete ban and destruction of nuclear weapons but that there was little hope other nuclear powers would soon adopt the same stance . 
00050000000000000000000000000

" Some nuclear powers stubbornly uphold policies of nuclear deterrence based on first use of nuclear weapons , " it said . 
0000000000000000000000

China held on July 29 what it said would be its last nuclear test before a self-imposed moratorium that took effect the following day . 
5000000000000000000000000

China was the last declared nuclear power to announce a halt to testing .

Japan declares food poisoning threat receding . 
5000000

TOKYO 1996-08-27 
50

The government said on Tuesday that the threat from a mysterious killer germ , while still requiring vigilance , appears to be receding in the western Japan city of Sakai , where the epidemic hit the hardest . 
00000000000000000000000000500500000000

The food poisoning epidemic caused by the O-157 colon bacillus in Sakai appears to be " settling down " , Health Minister Naoto Kan was quoted by a government spokesman as telling the cabinet . 
00000007000500000000003400000000000

The O-157 colon bacillus has been found responsible for a widespread food poisoning epidemic that has killed 11 people and made over 9,500 ill this year . 
070000000000000000000000000

Sakai , near the regional commercial centre of Osaka , has been hit hardest by the deadly bacteria , with nearly 6,500 , mostly schoolchildren , affected by the disease . 
5000000050000000000000000000000

Two children in Sakai have died from complications associated with the bacteria . 
0005000000000

Kan told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that no new victims have been reported since August 8 , indicating that the peak has passed , at least for Sakai . 
300000000000000000000000000050

Sakai officials agreed with the assessment , but said it was too early to feel relieved . 
50000000000000000

" There are still patients hospitalised and problems which must be dealt with , " a city spokesman said , citing the issue of whether to allow children infected with the bacteria but not showing symptoms to attend school from September . 
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Health authorities believe school lunches were the source of the food poisoning in Sakai , but researchers have been unable to pinpoint the exact source of the infection . 
00000000000005000000000000000

The outbreak has prompted authorities to tighten sanitary standards at slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants and sparked calls for an overhaul of the nation 's school lunch programme . 
0000000000000000000000000000

The ministers agreed at Tuesday 's cabinet meeting to step up inspection measures for school lunches in September and October , when schools around the country resume . 
0000000000000000000000000000

Japan 's Agriculture Ministry also announced that it will compile hygiene guidelines based on U.S. government methods of checking the safety of farm produce to prevent another outbreak of the epidemic . 
50120000000000500000000000000000

As of Monday , 31 children were still hospitalised in Sakai city , of whom six were in serious condition .

Japan aluminium shipments surge 8.9 pct in July . 
500000000

TOKYO 1996-08-27

Japanese shipments of aluminium mill products in July surged 8.9 percent over the same month last year to 224,609 tonnes , while production rose 6.4 percent to 222,457 tonnes , according to preliminary data released on Tuesday by the Japan Aluminium Federation . 
7000000000000000000000000000000000000001220

The surge reflected strong demand from the beverage can and housing construction sectors , federation officials said . 
000000000000000000

Figures released two weeks ago from Japan 's seven largest mills already showed that Japan 's can sheet output reached its highest monthly level ever in July , reflecting above-average temperatures that sparked a jump in beer consumption . 
000000500000005000000000000000000000000

A federation official added that the half-year through September 1996 also appeared likely to set a new record for can production , despite cooler temperatures in August . 
0000000000000000000000000000

July inventories stood at 75,632 tonnes , down 2.6 percent from the prior month . 
000000000000000

July foil output was off 0.2 percent year-on-year at 11,525 tonnes , while foil shipments fell 0.8 percent to 11,244 tonnes . 
0000000000000000000000

June mill output data were revised slightly downward to 210,622 tonnes from the preliminary 210,683 , while shipments were revised marginally upward to 213,989 tonnes from 213,845 . 
0000000000000000000000000000

Final figures for June pegged can stock shipments at 40,144 tonnes , up 2.4 percent year-on-year . 
00000000000000000

Shipments to the auto sector fell 5.5 percent to 15,286 tonnes , while the construction sector rose 2.4 percent to 79,390 tonnes . 
00000000000000000000000

Exports dipped 3.7 percent to 18,867 tonnes .

China 's President Jiang Zemin offered his gratitude in a meeting on Monday with visiting Gabon President Omar Bongo , the official Xinhua news agency said . 
500340000000000503400010000

Jiang also acknowledged the Central African nation 's support for China 's stance on Taiwan , which Beijing views as a renegade province , while Bongo was quoted as thanking China for economic and technological aid , the agency said late on Monday .

In April , China quashed a draft resolution by the U.N. Human Rights Commission expressing concern over continuing reports of Beijing 's violations of fundamental freedoms . 
000500000012220000005000000

After the defeat of the resolution , drafted by the European Union and the United States , China 's Foreign Ministry thanked 26 countries for backing its motion for " no action " on the document . 
0000000000120056050120000000000000000

It was the sixth year in a row that China avoided censure at the U.N. 's main human rights forum . 
000000000500001000000

China has been accused of a wide range of human rights abuses , often in violation of its own legal code , in an effort to silence dissent .

Cooperative Bank of Taiwan , one of the island 's leading state-run banks , said it was cutting its prime lending rate by 0.05 percentage point , effective on Tuesday . 
1222000000000000000000000000000

The bank said in a statement it was cutting its prime lending rate to 7.35 percent from 7.40 percent . 
00000000000000000000

It also would cut its three-month-to-three-year time deposit rates by between 0.05 and 0.10 percentage points . 
00000000000000000

The moves made Cooperative the first major bank to cut rates in response to a call on Friday from central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong . 
0001000000000000000000340

In the central bank 's latest bid to jumpstart Taiwan 's sluggish economy , Sheu ordered a reduction of up to a half-percentage point in banks ' reserve requirements and called on commercial banks to pass on the savings in the form of interest rate reductions .

Israeli police demolished a 10 metre ( yard ) by 20 metre structure in Jerusalem 's Old City they said had been built with funding from the Palestinian self-rule Authority for use as a social club . 
7000000000000050560000000001220000000

Police used a huge crane to lift a bulldozer over the Old City 's walls to reach the building amidst narrow alleys , witnesses said . 
00000000000560000000000000

Bystanders at the scene said work had begun on the building in 1991 and it had yet to be completed when the Israeli police bulldozed it . 
000000000000000000000070000

The Palestinian Authority was set up under the 1993 PLO-Israel interim peace deal .

" There has been a call for a general strike between one ( 1000 GMT ) and three o'clock , " Palestinian lawmaker Ahmed Hashem Zighayer told Reuters . 
00000000000000700000070344010

" This is a war that has been declared on us and we want our people to come and see the site where they declared the war . " 
00000000000000000000000000000

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's government , which took office in June , has said it will not allow the Authority , set up under a 1993 interim peace deal to control parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank , to operate in Jerusalem . 
0034000000000000000010000000000000056056000050

Israel 's previous government held the same position but in general turned a blind eye to Palestinian Authority activity in the city . 
50000000000000001200000

Tuesday 's demolition came a day after PLO officials said they had bowed to Netanyahu 's demand they close offices in Jerusalem . 
00000001000000300000050

They said two of the three offices Israel wanted closed had been shut . 
00000005000000

Netanyahu has made closure of the three offices a condition for resuming peace negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) .

Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it .

It says it will never cede any part of the city .

Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of a future state .

The city is up for negotiation at final peace talks which have yet to resume under Netanyahu .

SEC adopts rules to improve investor access to best stock prices . 
100000000000

WASHINGTON 1996-08-28 
50

The Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday approved rules designed to give stock market investors a better chance at getting the best price available for their orders . 
012220000000000000000000000

The so-called order handling rules , which were proposed last September , were approved in a 4-0 vote . 
0000000000000000000

The new rules will require specialists at stock exchanges and market makers on Nasdaq to allow customers to view price quotes from other electronic trading systems that may not be readily available to them . 
00000000000007000000000000000000000

The rules will also require that customer limit orders be displayed with prices better than those available in quotes publicly available at the time . 
0000000000000000000000000

Specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock . 
00000000000000000000

In a limit order , investors specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell , as opposed to a market order executed at prevailing prices . 
000000000000000000000000000000

" These rules are intended to empower all investors , by allowing their orders to compete on a level playing field , and by providing the disclosure they need to make informed decisions , " said SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt . 
00000000000000000000000000000000000010340

The SEC 's goal , he added , was to create " one system where one price could be available to everybody . " 
010000000000000000000000

The director of the SEC 's division of market regulation , Richard Lindsey , said Wall Street firms will probably need to spend about $ 7 million to carry out the improvements called for by the new rules . 
000010000003400560000000000000000000000

In proposing the rules last year , the SEC noted that while technology has improved , commonplace practices still existed that worked against investors ' best interests . 
0000000010000000000000000000

It noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market . 
00000000000000000000000

It also cited the potential problem of a two-tiered market in which market makers quote one price to public investors while quoting better prices in private systems , thus robbing investors without access to " hidden " quotes the benefit of the best available prices . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Earlier this month , the SEC settled charges of alleged malpractices on Nasdaq when the parent of the Nasdaq market , the National Association of Securities Dealers , agreed to spend $ 100 million over five years to upgrade its oversight of brokers ' trading practices . 
00000100000070000070001222200000000000000000000

The SEC dropped a third proposal that would have allowed investors with market orders to trade at a better price if there were shifts in prices before their orders were executed . 
01000000000000000000000000000000

The agency said it would monitor effects of the two new rules before considering the " price improvement " proposal again . 
0000000000000000000000

The agency also proposed rule changes that would require continuous " bid " and " ask " quotations from exchange specialists and market makers who trade more than 1 percent of a stock during any quarter on Nasdaq . 
000000000000000000000000000000000000070

The SEC 's limit order display rule will mean a major change for Nasdaq , where such orders have never been displayed . 
01000000000007000000000

The president of the Nasdaq , Alfred Berkeley , was to hold a news conference Wednesday afternoon to elaborate on the new rules ' effects on the market , the second largest in the world .

ITALIAN CABINET APPROVES TELEVISION DECREE . 
700000

ROME 1996-08-28 
50

The Italian cabinet on Wednesday granted a reprieve for media mogul Silvio Berlusconi 's Mediaset television empire with a decree extending the current legal framework for television stations until January 31 , 1997 . 
0700000000034010000000000000000000

The decree plugs a legal void in which magistrates could have forced the former prime minister to take one of the three stations he controls off the air because of a court ruling that no single proprietor should be allowed to keep three channels .

Passengers injured in train collision in Linz . 
00000050

LINZ , Austria 1996-08-28 
5050

A passenger train collided with a locomotive at a main railway station in Linz on Wednesday and police said around 10 people were injured . 
0000000000000500000000000

Austrian television reported earlier that more than 20 had been hurt in the accident at the station in Linz , 300 km ( 180 miles ) west of Vienna . 
700000000000000000500000000050

" One locomotive was stationary and the passenger train collided into the back of it , " a police spokesman in Linz told Reuters by telephone . 
000000000000000000000501000

The express passenger train travelling from Steyr , southeast of Linz , with around 80 people on board , hit the back of a service locomotive used to shunt wagons into sidings . 
000000500050000000000000000000000

The police spokesman said he was not sure whether any more passengers were still trapped in the wreckage . 
0000000000000000000

Doctors and medical staff from a hospital across the road from the station were at the scene of the accident within minutes and were able to treat the injured quickly , he added . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000

Greater damage was averted as the driver of the passenger train had time to apply his emergency brakes before the collision occurred , a state railways spokesman told Austrian news agency APA .

Saskatchewan Wheat Pool eyes hog market . 
1220000

WINNIPEG 1996-08-28 
50

Canada 's largest grain handling firm said Wednesday it expects to forge a partnership with hog farmers by 1997 with a view to expanding the company 's scope into pork production . 
50000000000000000000000000000000

" Saskatchewan is well positioned to take advantage of growing world markets for pork , " Saskatchewan Wheat Pool chief executive Don Loewen said in a company statement . 
05000000000000001220034000000

SWP said it was analyzing potential partnerships with hog farmers and expected the first deal to be in place in 1997 . 
1000000000000000000000

The end of Canada 's rail freight subsidy last year caused a shift in feed grain production to the eastern Prairie . 
0005000000000000000000

Analysts said livestock production would likely shift to the eastern Prairie rather than feed grains being shipped to the western Prairie . 
0000000000000000000000

SWP said it may develop pork production systems that provide farmers with large integrated units , and it may consider contracting programs between producers and packers which would operate within the existing hog market framework . 
100000000000000000000000000000000000

Saskatchewan Pork International Marketing Group has an export monopoly but some Saskatchewan farmers earlier this month called for an open market in hogs .

Britain 's Chris Boardman fulfilled his prediction that he would break the world 4,000 metres world record in the world track cycling championships on Wednesday . 
50340000000000000000000000

Boardman clocked four minutes 13.353 seconds to slice more than six seconds from the previous world mark of 4:19.699 set by Olympic champion Andrea Collinelli of Italy in Atlanta in July . 
30000000000000000000070340505000

Collinelli qualified in second place , also beating his old record in 4:17.696 . 
30000000000000

" I was very nervous before the start but then I was amazed by the speed of my ride , " Boardman said . " 
0000000000000000000003000

I do n't know if I can go any faster . 
00000000000

Who knows what will happen in the later stages ? " 
00000000000

Boardman , 28 , did not contest the Olympic pursuit because of its proximity to the Tour de France in which he led the French GAN team . 
3000000070000000788000007100

However , he took a bronze medal in the Olympic road time-trial and then returned home to prepare for the world track series in the Manchester indoor velodrome . 
00000000070000000000000005000

He adopted the " superman " riding position with arms at full stretch perfected by fellow Briton Graeme Obree , the 1995 world champion , and taken up in Atlanta by Collinelli . 
000000000000000073400000000005030

Obree was forced to pull out of his title defence because of a viral infection .

England soccer manager Glen Hoddle confirmed on Wednesday that the Liverpool pair of Steve McManaman and Robbie Fowler would miss England 's World Cup qualifying match against Moldova on Sunday . 
5003400000100340340050780005000

The two men , both suffering from back injuries , joined the England squad at training but it was soon clear they had no chance of making the flight to Kishinev on Friday . 
0000000000005000000000000000005000

" They had some scans and X-rays yesterday and they 're out , " said Hoddle . 
00000000000000030

" The more important thing for me was to get them down here and have a chat . 
000000000000000000

To go another five weeks without that chance would have been foolish , " he added . 
00000000000000000

Hoddle , who has already lost the services of midfielder Darren Anderton and defender Steve Howey , delayed naming any replacements . 
3000000000340034000000

There was also concern over injuries to Paul Gascoigne , Les Ferdinand and David Batty .

Redgrave is one of only five athletes who have won gold medals at four successive Olympics . 
30000000000000070

He shared victory with Matthew Pinsent in the coxless pairs at the Atlanta Games and said at the time that would be his last shot . 
00003400000078000000000000

But he has had second thoughts since then . " 
0000000000

I 'm only 34 . 
00000

Some say that 's too old for an athlete , " he said . 
00000000000000

" But I 'll be 38 by Sydney and that 's not too old . 
000000050000000

It 's whether I have got the enthusiasm for the training over the next four years . 
00000000000000000

Rowing is an endurance sport . "

Botham dashed back to Portsmouth and took the field as the thrid over began .
