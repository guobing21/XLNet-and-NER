West Indian all-rounder Phil Simmons took four for 38 on Friday as Leicestershire beat Somerset by an innings and 39 runs in two days to take over at the head of the county championship .

Their stay on top , though , may be short-lived as title rivals Essex , Derbyshire and Surrey all closed in on victory while Kent made up for lost time in their rain-affected match against Nottinghamshire .

After bowling Somerset out for 83 on the opening morning at Grace Road , Leicestershire extended their first innings by 94 runs before being bowled out for 296 with England discard Andy Caddick taking three for 83 .

Trailing by 213 , Somerset got a solid start to their second innings before Simmons stepped in to bundle them out for 174 .

Essex , however , look certain to regain their top spot after Nasser Hussain and Peter Such gave them a firm grip on their match against Yorkshire at Headingley . 
100000000000340340000000001050

Hussain , considered surplus to England 's one-day requirements , struck 158 , his first championship century of the season , as Essex reached 372 and took a first innings lead of 82 . 
3000050000000000000000100000000000

By the close Yorkshire had turned that into a 37-run advantage but off-spinner Such had scuttled their hopes , taking four for 24 in 48 balls and leaving them hanging on 119 for five and praying for rain . 
000100000000030000000000000000000000000

At the Oval , Surrey captain Chris Lewis , another man dumped by England , continued to silence his critics as he followed his four for 45 on Thursday with 80 not out on Friday in the match against Warwickshire . 
00501034000005000000000000000000000000010

He was well backed by England hopeful Mark Butcher who made 70 as Surrey closed on 429 for seven , a lead of 234 . 
0000050340000100000000000

Derbyshire kept up the hunt for their first championship title since 1936 by reducing Worcestershire to 133 for five in their second innings , still 100 runs away from avoiding an innings defeat . 
1000000000000010000000000000000000

Australian Tom Moody took six for 82 but Chris Adams , 123 , and Tim O'Gorman , 109 , took Derbyshire to 471 and a first innings lead of 233 .

After the frustration of seeing the opening day of their match badly affected by the weather , Kent stepped up a gear to dismiss Nottinghamshire for 214 . 
0000000000000000010000001000

They were held up by a gritty 84 from Paul Johnson but ex-England fast bowler Martin McCague took four for 55 .

By stumps Kent had reached 108 for three .

SOCCER - SHEARER NAMED AS ENGLAND CAPTAIN . 
00300500

LONDON 1996-08-30 
50

The world 's costliest footballer Alan Shearer was named as the new England captain on Friday . 
00000340000050000

The 26-year-old , who joined Newcastle for 15 million pounds sterling ( $ 23.4 million ) , takes over from Tony Adams , who led the side during the European championship in June , and former captain David Platt . 
0000010000000000000034000000070000000340

Adams and Platt are both injured and will miss England 's opening World Cup qualifier against Moldova on Sunday . 
30300000050078005000

Shearer takes the captaincy on a trial basis , but new coach Glenn Hoddle said he saw no reason why the former Blackburn and Southampton skipper should not make the post his own . 
3000000000003400000000101000000000

" I 'm sure there wo n't be a problem , I 'm sure Alan is the man for the job , " Hoddle said . 
00000000000000300000000300

" There were three or four people who could have done it but when I spoke to Alan he was up for it and really wanted it . 
0000000000000000030000000000

" In four days it 's very difficult to come to a 100 percent conclusion about something like this ... 
00000000000000000000

but he knows how to conduct himself , his team mates respect him and he knows about the team situation even though he plays up front . " 
0000000000000000000000000000

Shearer 's Euro 96 striking partner Teddy Sheringham withdrew from the squad with an injury on Friday . 
307800340000000000

He will probably be replaced by Shearer 's Newcastle team mate Les Ferdinand .

Rotor Volgograd must play their next home game behind closed doors after fans hurled bottles and stones at Dynamo Moscow players during a 1-0 home defeat on Saturday that ended Rotor 's brief spell as league leaders . 
12000000000000000012000000000010000000

The head of the Russian league 's disciplinary committee , Anatoly Gorokhovsky , said on Friday that Rotor would play Lada Togliatti to empty stands on September 3 . 
00007000003400000100120000000

The club , who put Manchester United out of last year 's UEFA Cup , were fined $ 1,000 . 
00000120000078000000

Despite the defeat , Rotor are well placed with 11 games to play in the championship . 
00001000000000000

Lying three points behind Alania and two behind Dynamo Moscow , the Volgograd side have a game in hand over the leaders and two over the Moscow club .

BOXING - PANAMA 'S ROBERTO DURAN FIGHTS THE SANDS OF TIME .

PANAMA CITY 1996-08-30

Panamanian boxing legend Roberto " Hands of Stone " Duran climbs into the ring on Saturday in another age-defying attempt to sustain his long career . 
70034444440000000000000000

Duran , 45 , takes on little-known Mexican Ariel Cruz , 30 , in a super middleweight non-title bout in Panama City . 
30000007340000000000560

The fight , Duran 's first on home soil for 10 years , is being billed here as the " Return of the Legend " and Duran still talks as if he was in his prime . 
0003000000000000000078880030000000000

" I want a fifth title . 
0000000

This match is to prepare me . 
0000000

I feel good . 
0000

I 'm not retiring , " Duran told Reuters . 
0000003010

But those close to the boxer acknowledge that the man who has won championships in four different weight classes -- lightweight , welterweight , junior middleweight and middleweight -- is drawing close to the end of his career . 
000000000000000000000000000000000000000

" Each time he fights , he 's on the last frontier of his career . 
0000000000000000

If he loses Saturday , it could devalue his position as one of the world 's great boxers , " Panamanian Boxing Association President Ramon Manzanares said . 
0000000000000000000071203400

Duran , whose 97-12 record spans three decades , hopes a win in the 10-round bout will earn him a rematch against Puerto Rico 's Hector " Macho " Camacho . 
3000000000000000000000560344440

Camacho took a controversial points decision against the Panamanian in Atlantic City in June in a title fight .

TENNIS - TARANGO , O'BRIEN SPRING TWIN UPSETS UNDER THE LIGHTS .

NEW YORK 1996-08-30 
560

Andre Agassi escaped disaster on Thursday but Wimbledon finalist MaliVai Washington and Marcelo Rios were not so fortunate on a night of upsets at the U.S. Open . 
3400000703403400000000000780

The 11th-seeded Washington fell short of reprising his Wimbledon miracle comeback as he lost to red-hot wildcard Alex O'Brien 6-3 6-4 5-7 3-6 6-3 in a two hour 51 minute struggle on the Stadium court . 
003000007000000003400000000000000000

Next door on the grandstand , 10th seed Rios lost to another player with a Wimbledon connection -- bad boy Jeff Tarango . 
00000000300000070000340

The temperamental left-hander defeated the Chilean 6-4 4-6 7-6 6-2 . 
00000700000

The day programme went smoothly although sixth-seeded former champion Agassi had to wriggle out of a dangerous 3-6 0-4 hole , winning 18 of the last 19 games against India 's Leander Paes . 
0000000003000000000000000000050340

But the night belonged to the upstarts . 
00000000

Washington , who climbed back from a 1-5 deficit , two sets down in the third set against Todd Martin in the Wimbledon semifinals , looked poised for another sensational comeback . 
30000000000000000034007000000000

O'Brien , a winner two weeks ago in New Haven for his first pro title , served for the match at 5-4 in the third set before Washington came charging back . 
30000000560000000000000000030000

" I just kept saying to myself , ' keep giving yourself the best chance to win , keep battling , maybe something will happen , ' " said the 26-year-old O'Brien , ranked 65th . 
000000000000000000000000000000030000

" I kept my composure and I was proud of myself for that -- usually I would have folded up the tent and gone home . " 
000000000000000000000000000

The hard-serving O'Brien , a former U.S. collegiate national champion , fired up 17 aces to ultimately subdue the never-say-die Washington . 
0030005000000000000030

The fifth set stayed on serve until the sixth game , when Washington , after saving one break point with a forehand winner down the line , netted a backhand to give O'Brien a 4-2 lead . 
0000000000003000000000000000000030000

The Texan blasted in two aces to hold serve at 5-2 and then converted his eighth match point for victory when Washington found the net with another backhand from 40-0 . 
0700000000000000000003000000000

" You just kind of keep fighting and you keep trying to make him play a little bit . 
0000000000000000000

I think he got a little tight at a couple of moments , " said Washington . " 
000000000000000300

But I think he served pretty well when he had to . " 
0000000000000

Tarango , whose Wimbledon tantrum two years ago brought him a $ 28,000 fine and suspension from this year 's tournament at the All-England Club , argued calls and taunted fans in his lively two hour , 24 minute tango with Rios on the grandstand . 
3007000000000000000000012000000000000000030000

A boisterous cheering section backed the distracted Chilean and booed the lanky American , who ate up all the attention . 
000000070000700000000

" I 'm an emotional player , " said the 104th-ranked Tarango . " 
00000000000300

I think I played very well tonight , very focused . " 
000000000000

The match turned on the third-set tiebreaker , which the American won 7-5 much to the dismay of the spectators . 
000000000070000000000

" I love the crowd if they boo me every day . 
000000000000

It fires me up , makes me play my best tennis , " Tarango said . 
0000000000000300

" I played some of my best tennis in college when fraternities were throwing beer on me . 
000000000000000000

If tennis was like that every day , I think everybody wold be having a lot more fun . " 
00000000000000000000

Rios did not appreciate Tarango 's antics . 
30003000

" He 's always complaining too much , " said Rios . " 
0000000000300

But I think it 's not that . 
00000000

I think I played really bad . 
0000000

It was tough to play at night . 
00000000

Balls were going really fast . 
000000

I lost too many points that I never lose . 
0000000000

I did n't play my tennis . " 
00000000

" I do n't see the ball like I see during the day . 
00000000000000

I play an American so that 's why I play at night . 
0007000000000

I did n't feel good on the court . " 
0000000000

At the end of the match , Tarango blew sarcastic kisses to the crowd , then jiggled his body to a Rios rooting section in a jeering salute . 
00000003000000000000030000000

" I support their enthusiasm , " Tarango said about the fans . " 
00000003000000

At the same time , they 're cheering blatantly against me . 
000000000000

After I won I figured I could give them a little razzle-dazzle . "

PHILADELPHIA 1996-08-29

Randall Cunningham , the National Football League 's all-time leading rusher as a quarterback and one of the most athletic players ever to line up over centre , retired Thursday . 
3400122000000000000000000000000

Cunningham played his entire 11-year career with the Philadelphia Eagles . 
30000000120

A three-time Pro Bowl selection , Cunningham rushed for 4,482 yards on 677 carries . 
007800300000000

" I would like to thank the Eagles organisation and the wonderful fans of Philadelphia for supporting me throughout my career , " Cunningham said . 
00000001000000100000000300

" Although it saddens me to leave , I am looking forward to spending more time with my family and pursuing other interests that have been on the back burner for sometime . " 
0000000000000000000000000000000000

" Randall was one of the most exciting quarterbacks in NFL history , " said Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie . " 
030000000010000103400

During his 11 years in Philadelphia , Randall was the cornerstone of the Eagles ' franchise and brought many great moments to fans in Philadelphia as well as across the NFL . " 
000005030000010000000000500000100

A second-round choice in 1985 , Cunningham completed 1,874-of-3,362 passes ( 55.7 percent ) for 22,877 yards and 150 touchdowns . 
000000300000000000000

Cunningham has already been signed as a broadcaster .

GOLF - HENKE TAKES LEAD IN MILWAUKEE , WOODS MAKES PRO DEBUT . 
0030005030000

MILWAUKEE , Wisconsin 1996-08-29 
5050

Nolan Henke fired a nine-under-par 62 to grab a two-shot lead after the opening round of the $ 1.2 million Greater Milwaukee Open Thursday as 20-year-old Tiger Woods shot 67 in his professional debut . 
34000000000000000000788000340000000

Henke stood two strokes ahead of Bob Estes and three up on Billy Andrade , Duffy Waldorf and Jesper Parnevik . 
300000340000340340340

Woods , who turned pro Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive U.S. Amateur Championship , almost eagled the 18th hole . 
3000000000007880000000

He settled for a birdie and a four-under opening round that left him five shots off the pace . 
0000000000000000000

" Yesterday was the toughest day I 've had for a long time , " Woods said . " 
0000000000000003000

Today , I got to play golf . " 
000000000

He added : " I thought I got off off to a great start . 
000000000000000

It was a perfect start . 
000000

I 'm in a good position . " 
00000000

Henke , who called his round a " pleasant surprise , " finished with six birdies on the final eight holes . 
3000000000000000000000

" We finally got things going in the right direction , " he said . " 
0000000000000000

It was my best round in a very long time . 
00000000000

My short game has improved since I 've had to use it so often . 
000000000000000

That 's always been the worst part of my game . 
00000000000

All in all , playing bad 's been a good experience . " 
0000000000000

Henke , who came within one shot of the course record set by Andrew Magee during Wednesday 's pro-am , has three career PGA Tour victories , but none since the 1993 BellSouth Classic . 
30000000000003400000000780000000780

Estes , whose only win came at the 1994 Texas Open and whose best finish this year was a third-place tie at the Nortel Open in January , eagled the par-five fourth hole and added five birdies to grab sole possession of second place . 
300000000780000000000007800000000000000000000

" No bogeys on the card , " he noted . " 
000000000000

Sometimes I take more pride in that . " 
000000000

Woods was among a group of 13 players at four under , including 1993 champion Billy Mayfair , who tied for second at last week 's World Series of Golf , and former U.S. Open champ Payne Stewart . 
300000000000000340000000007888000780340

Defending champion Scott Hoch shot a three-under 68 and was six strokes back . 
00340000000000

Phil Mickelson , the only four-time winner on the PGA Tour , skipped the tournament after winning the World Series of Golf last week . 
3400000007800000007888000

Mark Brooks , Tom Lehman and Mark O'Meara , who make up the rest of the top four on the money list , also took the week off .

Spanish first division team Deportivo Coruna will be without key midfielder Mauro Silva for Saturday 's game with Real Madrid after FIFA , soccer 's world governing body , suspended the Brazilian for one game for missing his national side 's European tour . 
70001200000340000012010000000007000000000700

Silva excused his absence from Brazil 's game against Russia , on Wednesday , and Saturday 's match with the Netherlands by saying he had lost his passport .

But that did not prevent him from collecting the one-match suspension .

American Dennis Mitchell outclassed Olympic 100 metres champion Donovan Bailey for the third time at a major post-Games meeting in front of the most experienced sprinting crowd in the world on Friday . 
734070003400000007000000000000000

Watched by an array of former Olympic sprint champions at the Berlin grand prix meeting , Mitchell made a brilliant start in the 100 metres and held off Bailey 's strong finish to win in 10.08 seconds despite cool conditions . 
00000070000500003000000000003000000000000

Bailey , who set a world record of 9.84 on his way to victory in Atlanta , could not catch his American rival and had to settle for third in a tight finish . 
3000000000000005000007000000000000

Jamaica 's Michael Green was second with 10.09 with Bailey finishing in 10.13 . 
50340000030000

Last Friday Mitchell , who finished fourth at the Atlanta Games , upstaged a trio of Olympic champions including Bailey to win the 100 in Brussels . 
003000000780000070030000050

Earlier this month he also beat world champion Bailey in Zurich . 
000000003050

Berlin , Brussels and Zurich all belong to the most lucrative series in the sport , the Golden Four . 
50505000000000000780

Among the crowd on Friday were Olympic 100 metres champions going back to 1948 . 
000000700000000

They had been invited to the meeting to watch a special relay to mark the 60th anniversary of Jesse Owens 's four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics in the same Berlin stadium . 
0000000000000000003400000007000500

" Today the concentration was the most important thing for me , " Mitchell said . 
0000000000000300

Despite the coolish conditions American Olympic champion Gail Devers looked in commanding form in the women 's 100 , clocking 10.89 to defeat Jamaican rival Merlene Ottey , who was second in 10.94 .

UEFA came down heavily on Belgian club Standard Liege on Friday for " disgraceful behaviour " in an Intertoto final match against Karlsruhe of Germany . 
10000701200000000070001050

The Belgian club were fined 25,000 Swiss francs ( $ 20,850 ) for unsporting conduct and captain Guy Hellers banned for seven games .

He was sent off for insulting the referee and then urged his team mates to protest . 
00000000000000000

Roberto Bisconti will be sidelined for six Euro ties after pushing the referee in the back as he protested about a Karlsruhe goal , while Didier Ernst was banned for four matches for a verbal attack soon after Bisconti was also dismissed . 
3400000700000000000001000340000000000030000

Karlsruhe won the August 20 match 3-1 thanks to two late goals .

The International Amateur Athletic Federation said on Friday that a schedule reshuffle had allowed organisers to hold a men 's triple jump as well as the women 's long jump on the " one usable runway at the war-devastated " Kosevo stadium .

Atlanta Games silver medal winner Edwards has called on other leading athletes to take part in the Sarajevo meeting -- a goodwill gesture towards Bosnia as it recovers from the war in the Balkans -- two days after the grand prix final in Milan . 
780003000000000005000000500000000500000000050

Edwards was quoted as saying : " What type of character do we show by going to the IAAF Grand Prix Final in Milan where there is a lot of money to make but refusing to make the trip to Sarajevo as a humanitarian gesture ? "

Former Italian international winger Gianluigi Lentini , transferred to Milan in 1992 for what was believed to be a world record sum , has been loaned to serie A club Atalanta for a year , newspapers reported on Friday . 
0700340001000000000000000007801000000000

The Gazzetta dello Sport said the deal would cost Atalanta around $ 600,000 . 
01220000010000

Lentini , 27 , joined Milan from Torino in a $ 12 million deal that many have speculated involved far more money changing hands and which has subsequently been investigated by magistrates for alleged financial irregularities . 
3000010100000000000000000000000000000

The player suffered severe head injuries in a near-fatal car crash the following year and has since struggled to regain the form that made him a hero in Turin . 
000000000000000000000000000050

The move to Bergamo-based Atalanta reunites Lentini , who fell out with ex-Milan coach Fabio Capello last season , with his former coach at Torino , Emiliano Mondonico .

ROMANIA COMELF H1 PROFIT RISE BELOW TARGET . 
51000000

BUCHAREST 1996-08-30 
50

Romanian listed state engineer Comelf said it almost doubled six-month output , with net profit rising by 33 percent to 1.069 billion lei . 
700010000000000000000000

But the company complained inflation and the artificially high rate of the leu cut profit margins on exports , keeping profits well below its forecast of 1.4 billion lei . 
000000000000000000000000000000

Comelf 's six-month output rose to 4,378 tonnes of equipment from 2,684 tonnes in the equivalent period in 1995 , the company report to the Bucharest stock exchange showed . 
100000000000000000000000050000

Comelf , based in the central Transylvanian town of Bistrita , manufactures water purification equipment , machinery for the thermal power sector and other equipment . 
10000070050000000000000000

" In the first six months of 1996 we concentrated on increasing the volume of our output and exports in particular and improving the quality of our products , " the report said . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000

From January to June Comelf exported 59 percent of its output , up from 37.3 percent in the same period last year . 
00001000000000000000000

The company said higher than anticipated inflation and rising raw materials and wage costs also hit profits . 
000000000000000000

Year-on-year inflation , initially estimated at 20 percent in December , was 33.8 percent in June , higher than a revised end-year forecast of 30 percent . 
000000000000000000000000000

The 12 month figure quickened to 40.3 percent in July . 
00000000000

The leu currency has slipped only gradually this year , and is currently quoted at an official rate of 3,162 to the dollar , well below the 3,550 retail price that exporters say is more realistic .

U.S. debt futures end lower , shaken by Chicago NAPM . 
50000000510

CHICAGO 1996-08-30

U.S. debt futures finished a shortened pre-holiday session sharply lower , as the markets were shaken by a stronger than expected rise in the August National Association of Purchasing Management ( NAPM ) index for the Chicago area , traders and analysts said . 
50000000000000000000000001222201000050000000

The August Chicago NAPM rose 8.8 points to 60.0 , its highest level since 62.6 in February 1995 and the largest monthly rise since December 1993 . 
005100000000000000000000000

Primary dealers immediately sold Eurodollar and bond futures , after the market on average was expecting the index to rise marginally to 51.9 from July 's 51.2 . 
0000700000000000000000000000

Traders also said Japanese investors were unwinding long Eurodollar futures / short swaps , and that heavy put buying helped pressure Eurodollars to lower levels before the close . 
00070000700000000000070000000

One U.S. firm bought 35,000 September 97 mid-curve put options at a strike price of 93.25 to 93.30 in the last two sessions , while a French firm bought 4,000 September 93.30 to 93.32 put spreads . 
0500000000000000000000000070000000000

" Even before the data came out , we were seeing put buying , " one floor trader said . 
00000000000000000000

Meanwhile , funds were reportedly good sellers of five-year notes . 
00000000000

Rumors circulated that the Federal Reserve was buying five-year notes , and that a renowned hedge fund manager was buying 10-year notes in the cash markets . 
000012000000000000000000000

However , December T-bonds ended below a major trendline level at 106-26/32 , as the yield in the cash bond market set its highest monthly close since April 1995 at 7.12 percent , one analyst said . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000000

December bonds blew through the July 30 low of 107-06/32 , even though conditions were slightly oversold , traders said . 
000000000000000000000

The December calendar spread continued to widen , also reflecting the market 's fear of rising inflation . 
000000000000000000

While the market continues to price-in higher U.S. interest rates , there was little conviction to the theory that the Federal Reserve would tighten rates before the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 24 . 
0000000500000000000012000000122200000

Federal Reserve governor Lawrence Lindsey , speaking on U.S. cable television network CNBC , said the U.S. economy appears on balance to be a bit strong , adding the central bank would not curb growth provided inflation remains in check . 
12034000500010005000000000000000000000000

Earlier in the day , Fed chairman Alan Greenspan said at the annual Jackson Hole symposium that the goal of price stability is within reach for major nations . 
00000103400007880000000000000

Traders said the Fed 's decision to adopt a tightening bias at the July FOMC meeting has cast more focus on every piece of U.S. economic news .

" The Fed 's stance has really sensitized us to all this data , " one analyst said . "

Shares of Douglas & Lomason Co were up 4-1/2 at 30-5/8 Friday afternoon after Thursday 's announcement that the vehicle seat maker had agreed to be acquired by Magna International Inc for $ 31 a share , or $ 135 million . 
001222000000000000000000000012200000000000

Magna was up 1/8 to 48-1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange . 
1000000012220

Douglas & Lomason has 4.45 million common shares outstanding , some of which are option shares to be purchased at exercise prices less than the $ 31 offered price . 
122000000000000000000000000000

The acquisition will beef up Markham , Ontario-based Magna 's North American car and truck seating business , allowing it to better compete with Johnson Controls Inc and Lear Corp . 
0000010710780000000000001220120

Family-controlled Douglas & Lomason , which had 1995 revenue of $ 561 million , was finding it more difficult to compete for new seating contracts from vehicle makers , said James Hoey , chief financial officer . 
0122000000000000000000000000003400000

" Unfortunately , in the auto industry these days , a $ 500 million company is not a big company anymore , " Hoey said . " 
000000000000000000000003000

This merger makes us much more competitive . " 
000000000

He added that Douglas & Lomason 's top executives have been asked to stay on with Magna after the merger , though their future roles have not yet been defined .

The company earned $ 11.2 million on sales of $ 299 million in the first six months of 1996 , up from year-earlier earnings of $ 4.7 million on sales of $ 285.7 million .

Iraqi captors of Sudanese jet charged with hijack .

LONDON 1996-08-30 
50

Seven Iraqis who seized a Sudanese airliner with 199 people aboard and forced it to fly to London were on Friday charged with hijack , ending speculation that they might be offered immediate asylum in Britain . 
0700070000000000050000000000000000050

Police said the seven men , who freed all their hostages after the plane landed at Stansted airport on Tuesday and then appealed for asylum , would appear in court on Saturday . 
000000000000000050000000000000000

The Iraqis claimed they were " ordinary people persecuted by the regime of Saddam ( Hussein ) " but interior ministry officials had consistently said it was likely the seven would be charged with hijack before any plea for asylum was considered . 
0700000000000303000120000000000000000000000

Under English law the maximum sentence for hijack is life imprisonment , but there has been widespread speculation that the seven will receive lesser sentences and then be allowed to stay rather than being sent back to Iraq . 
070000000000000000000000000000000000050

The hijack began on Monday when an Amman-bound plane was taken over shortly after it took off from Khartoum . 
00000007000000000050

The hijackers threatened to blow it up during a refuelling stop in Cyprus unless they were taken to London .

After a search of the aircraft following the hijackers ' surrender , police found only knives and fake explosives .

Former world heavyweight champion Frank Bruno has quit the ring on medical advice , Britain 's Sun newspaper reported on Friday . 
0000340000000050100000

An eye specialist told the 35-year-old Bruno that he could be blinded in one eye if he boxed again , the newspaper said . 
000000300000000000000000

The Briton , who lost his World Boxing Council ( WBC ) title to Mike Tyson in March , said : " I was in shock as soon as he told me and it still has n't really sunk in . 
07000012201000340000000000000000000000000

" I never wanted to end like this but at the end of the day I 'm glad I had a good innings . " 
0000000000000000000000000

Bruno , for years one of Britain 's most popular sportsmen , had hoped to have another shot at the world title and had been in training until a routine eye test on Monday highlighted a problem with his right eye . 
300000500000000000000000000000000000000000

Professor David McLeod , who examined Bruno , told the Sun : " There is a risk he could be blinded in the eye if he steps into the ring again . 
03400030001000000000000000000000

He is in danger of getting a retinal detachment and there is no point in exposing himself to that . "

" Lebed is now in Chechnya solving some problems , " Interfax quoted Chernomyrdin as saying . "

The main thing is his programme . 
0000000

It was agreed with Boris Nikolayevich ( Yeltsin ) yesterday . "

Lebed , whom Yeltsin ordered to restore peace in Chechnya , struck a military deal with separatist rebels last week ending the worst fighting in the region in more than a year . 
300300000500000000000000000000000

He later discussed with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov a framework political agreement to tackle the most painful issue of the 20-month war -- the future political status of Chechnya . 
000000340000000000000000000050

Lebed said on Friday he hoped to sign a document with the rebels later in the day which would deal with the political settlement of the conflict . 
3000000000000000000000000000

Moscow , which wants to keep Chechnya as a part of the Russian Federation , sent troops to the region in December 1994 to quell its independence bid .

Lebed said he and Maskhadov agreed to defer by more than five years the painful issue of Chechnya 's political status .

Bosnia 's ruling Moslem nationalist party on Friday called on its refugee voters to end a boycott of absentee balloting in national elections , citing assurances provided by a U.S. envoy , government radio said . 
500700000000000000000000000005000000

The Bosnian government radio broadcast said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum had reassured SDA officials , including presumably its leader , Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic , whom he met during a Friday visit . 
070000500003400100000007034000000000

But the radio report did not specify what guarantees , if any , the U.S. envoy had provided . 
0000000000000050000

Absentee voting in the elections began on Wednesday , August 28 and runs for a week . 
00000000000000000

Election day for those living inside Bosnia is September 14 . 
00000050000

The Party of Democratic Action ( SDA ) had called on Wednesday for its followers abroad to boycott the absentee balloting because of voter registration irregularities , especially among Serb refugees . 
01222010000000000000000000000700

The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) postponed municipal elections as a result of the irregularities but decided to proceed with voting for higher offices . 
012222220100000000000000000000

The SDA , joined by two other parties , has been demanding that OSCE prohibit refugees voting from any place other than their pre-war place of residence as a means to prevent the elections from ratifying the results of ethnic cleansing .

Belgrade 's main airport Aerodrom Beograd will be closed to traffic for runway maintenance and modernization from September 21 to 26 , the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported late on Friday . 
50005600000000000000000700100000

" During the works , all flights will be re-routed to the nearby airport in Batajnica , with no change in schedules , " Tanjug quotes Belgrade airport General Director Ljubomir Acimovic as saying . 
00000000000000050000000010500034000

The airport in Surcin will continue to carry out all other activities and has secured enough buses to transport passengers to Batajnica , Acimovic said .

A senior Belarus politician accused President Alexander Lukashenko on Friday of attempting to set up a dictatorship in the former Soviet republic . 
00500034000000000000700

The speaker of the Belarus parliament , Semyon Sharetsky , told Reuters that a draft constitution , due to be put to a national referendum on November 7 , would dangerously increase the powers of the ruler . 
00005003400100000000000000000000000000

" The world community should not be indifferent to the fact that President Lukashenko , who leads this European state of 10 million people , is trying to establish a dictatorship with his new constitution , " Sharetsky said . 
0000000000000300007000000000000000000300

The new constitution calls for a two-chamber parliament with a 110-seat majority-elected house of representatives and a regionally-represented senate with a third of its members named by the president . 
000000000000000000000000000000

Lukashenko 's aides shrugged off Sharetsky 's charge . " 
3000030000

If there was a dictatorship they would n't have the right to say things like this , " Sergei Posukhov , Lukashenko 's political adviser , told Reuters . 
00000000000000000034030000010

" The people have asked us to establish order and that 's our main aim . " 
00000000000000000

Lukashenko , 41 , won presidential polls in 1994 on promises to restore order , fight corruption and repair the strong links with Russia that were disrupted by the collapse of the Soviet Union . 
30000000000000000000000500000000560

But during his period in office he has battled against nationalist opponents , trade unions and parliament and Sharetsky said the current parliament was ready to try to impeach him . 
0000000000000000003000000000000

" This constitution , which has been prepared in secret , aims to gather all power in one man 's hands , " he said . " 
000000000000000000000000000

We should not be fooled by his quasi-democratic rhetoric and his methods , like this referendum . " 
000000000000000000

Lukashenko signed a pact with Moscow in April to create a strong economic and political union which he believes could grow into a federation . 
3000050000000000000000000

But nationalist groups , scared by the prospect of renewed Moscow domination and Russia 's backing for Lukashenko , protested against the deal . 
000000000050050003000000

Lukashenko responded by cracking down on the nationalist opposition and jailing nearly 200 people for taking part in demonstrations against the pact .

Tajik government troops now control of the strategically vital town of Tavildara after driving out Islamic rebels , but sporadic gunfire still echoed in the nearby Pamir mountains on Friday . 
7000000000050007000000000050000

The commander-in-chief of Tajikistan 's armed forces , Major-General Nikolai Sherbatov , took a group of journalists by helicopter to the remote , and now devastated , town to show that his forces held it . 
000500000340000000000000000000000000

He said his troops took Tavildara without casualties on August 23 , but the crack of sniper and machinegun fire revealed the presence of opposition fighters in the surrounding mountains . 
0000050000000000000000000000000

Sherbatov said the rebels were located about three km ( two miles ) east of Tavildara around the village of Layron . 
3000000000000005000050

Tavildara , 200 km ( 120 miles ) east of the capital Dushanbe , was in ruins . 
500000000000500000

Shells had smashed roofs and windows and empty shell cases littered the streets . 
00000000000000

The town straddles a strategically important road linking government and rebel-held territory and has fallen succesively to both sides in a bloody tug-of-war which began last February . 
0000000000000000000000000000

Tajikistan , which borders Afghanistan and China , has been split by a dragging four-year conflict after a civil war between communists and a frail coalition of Islamic and liberal groups . 
50005050000000000000000000070000

Tens of thousands of people have been killed and many more have been displaced in the fighting , which breached a shaky United Nations-sponsored ceasefire . 
00000000000000000000007800

Tavildara is now apparently inhabited only by a few old men , women and their grubby , barefoot children . 
50000000000000000000

Fruit remained on the trees as there was no one to pick it . 
00000000000000

" Help me , help me , " said a chorus of women begging soldiers for food . 
000000000000000000

The town 's school and a shop doubling as a warehouse for humanitarian aid were destroyed in the fighting . 
00000000000000000000

" We had to build our own earth shelters to survive the fighting , " said Rajab Adinayev , a bearded elderly Tajik in a long white shirt . 
00000000000000003400007000000

Although shy in front of the government soldiers , several inhabitants accused government forces of widespread looting of homes and livestock . 
0000000000000000000000

They also said rebel fighters had looted medicines from the local hospital . 
0000000000000

One elderly man , who declined to give his name , said two of his sons were now refugees in Moscow and the other two had left to fight for the opposition . 
000000000000000000005000000000000

He also said government soldiers had raped the wife of one of his sons . "

Naina Yeltsin had a kidney operation last Saturday .

Earlier Russian news reports had said Yeltsin 's children and grandchildren had visited the Russian first lady but they said only that Yeltsin , on vacation outside Moscow , had spoken to her by telephone . 
070000300000007000000030000500000000

" Naina Yeltsin looks well , she is active , she is clearly getting better , " Yastrzhembsky quoted Yeltsin as saying . 
03400000000000000303000

Naina Yeltsin is recovering in Moscow 's Central Clinical Hospital , where the president himself was treated twice last year for heart attacks . 
340005056600000000000000

Yeltsin , 65 , has been seen only rarely since he was elected for a second term in office on July 3 , although his aides have denied a string of rumours that he has been taken ill again . 
3000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin had travelled from the hospital to spend the night at the Barvikha sanatorium outside Moscow .

Shares of France-registered printed packaging company Cofinec S.A. plunged sharply on the Budapest Stock Exchange ( BSE ) on Friday , despite a mostly reassuring forecast by the group . 
007000120000122010000000000000

Cofinec 's Global Depositary Receipts ( GDRs ) opened at 5,200 forints on the BSE , down 600 from Thursday 's close , following the release of its first half results this morning . 
1000000000000070000000000000000000

Cofinec CEO Stephen Frater told reporters in a conference call from Vienna on Friday before the opening of the bourse that he expects a stronger second half , although the group will not be able to achieve its annual profit goal . 
103400000005000000000000000000000000000000

" We will not achieve the full 37 million French franc ( net ) profit forecast , " Frater said . " 
0000000007000000003000

Obviously , we cannot make up the unexpected decrease that has been experienced in the first half of the year . " 
0000000000000000000000

Frater declined to give a forecast for the full year , ahead of a supervisory board meeting next week . 
30000000000000000000

Cofinec , the first foreign company to list on the Budapest bourse , released its consolidated first half figures ( IAS ) this morning . 
1000000000500000000000000

In the conference call , Frater said he regarded Cofinec GDRs -- which are trading below their issue price of 6,425 forints -- as a buying opportunity . 
0000030001000000000000000000

" Obviously , at some point it represents a buying opportunity , " Frater said . " 
00000000000003000

I think the reality is that we operate in emerging markets , emerging markets tend to be more volatile . " 
000000000000000000000

" My message is that the fundamental strategy of the company , its fundamental market position has not changed . " 
000000000000000000000

The group , which operates in Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic , reported an operating profit before interest of 21.8 million French francs compared to 34.1 million in the same six months of 1995 . 
0000005050056000000000070000000000000

Net profit for the January-June 1996 period was 2.1 million French francs , down from 10.3 million in the first six months of 1995 , with the bulk of this decline attributable to the performance of Petofi , one of its Hungarian units . 
00000000007000000000000000000000000010000700

Cofinec said Petofi general manager Laszlo Sebesvari had submitted his resignation and will be leaving Petofi but will remain on Petofi 's board of directors .

" Until a new general manager of Petofi is appointed ...

Eight claymore mines fitted with powerful C-4 plastic explosives were found stashed in a real estate office on Friday located about two blocks from Colombia 's presidential palace , police said . 
00000000000000000000000050000000

" These are powerful weapons , " a spokesman with the Municipal Police told Reuters by telephone , adding that police had not ruled out a possible terrorist attack on the ornate Casa de Narino presidential palace in Bogota 's historic downtown area .

He said police backed by explosive experts were combing the area in search of other possible weapons or explosive devices .

The police spokeman said plastic explosive like C-4 is not a normal component in claymore mines .

0070034000000000000000

Brunswijk had been in police custody for 10 days after Freddy Pinas , a Surinamese-born visitor from the Netherlands , accused Brunswijk of trying to kill him in a bar-room brawl in the mining town of Moengo 56 miles ( 90 km ) east of Paramaribo . 
30000000003400700050030000000000000050000000050

The Southeast Asian gold market was more or less a photo-fit picture of the previous week 's position with activity slow and bullion prices trapped in a well-worn range awaiting a seasonal upturn in demand and prices into the fourth quarter .

Singapore premiums for Australian kilo bars were quoted unchanged at between 25-45 cents an ounce over spot loco London prices , with South Korean and Indonesian-origin premiums also steady at 10-20 cents an ounce . 
50070000000000000050007807000000000

Singapore dealers said they were concerned that there had been a marked revival in offers to sell gold by South Korean traders , following the distress sales of recent months after the Seoul government 's crackdown on bullion arbitrage trade . 
50000000000000000007800000000000500000000

" I was shocked to see these offers coming in again , though there 's been no indication of price or volume . 
00000000000000000000000

I dread to think what will happen to the premiums if the Koreans start selling in force , " one dealer said . 
00000000000070000000000

Continued dishoarding of kilo-bars by Indonesian sources ahead of next year 's presidential election has also kept a lid on premiums .

Gold closed down at $ 387.00 / $ 387.50 an ounce in Hong Kong on Friday , versus New York 's $ 387.60 / $ 388 finish on Thursday .

Dealers said the precious metal eased on a report that the International Monetary Fund might sell some of its gold to reduce the debts of the poorest developing countries . 
000000000001220000000000000000

Easier silver prices mid-week helped keep spot gold locked in a $ 386 - $ 389 an ounce range , dealers said , but they remained optimistic that the usual seasonal pick-up in jewellery fabrication demand would see gold at $ 395 by end-October . 
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

" I still think we 'll see gold at $ 395 by the end of October , in a retracement of the $ 418 - $ 380 move we saw at the start of the year , " one said . 
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Silver , basis the September contract on New York 's Comex market , was expected to find support at between $ 5.12 - $ 5.15 an ounce and meet resistance from $ 5.25 - $ 5.30 , they added . 
0000000560000000000000000000000000000000

September silver closed up $ 0.004 in New York on Thursday at $ 5.255 an ounce .

Libyans are dressing up their capital Tripoli for celebrations on Sunday of the 27th anniversary of the coup which brought Muammar Gaddafi to power . 
7000005000000000000034000

Green flags and banners praise the " great revolution " and promise defiance against United Nations sanctions imposed for Libya 's refusal to hand over for trial two suspects wanted in connection with the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie , Scotland . 
0000000000000012000500000000000000000012005050

" We have chosen the challenge because it is our only option , " proclaimed one banner on the road to Tripoli airport which serves only internal flights because of the sanctions . 
000000000000000000000500000000000

Huge stadium lights are directed at the city 's Green Square where makeshift stages await Sunday 's festivities . 
0000000005600000000

Three African leaders -- from Niger , Guinea and Ghana -- are expected to attend the celebrations marking September 1 , 1969 when a group of young army officers , led by a 27-year-old Gaddafi , deposed King Mohammed Idris . 
07000505050000000000000000000000003000340

" The revolution has brought us great achievements ... 
000000000

We are comfortable the revolution has taken care of us , improved our lives and given us capabilites , " Samer Ammar Soliman , 42 , told Reuters as he came out of Friday prayers . 
000000000000000000003440000100000000

But some Libyans have begun to show their discontent in the country 's east , which has become a hotbed of militant violence . 
007000000000000000000000

Tripoli-based diplomats and exiled opponents said Gaddafi 's airforce blasted in July rebel strongholds in the mountainous Jebel al-Akhdar region .

Travellers arriving in Egypt say militants and police officers clash regularly in Benghazi . 
00050000000050

At least 20 people were killed in the capital in early July after bodyguards loyal to Gaddafi 's sons fired at spectators of a football match who were chanting subversive slogans . 
00000000000000003000000000000000

Gaddafi has dismissed any unrest as the work of foreigners , and last year deported thousands of Sudanese and Egyptian workers .

Twilight zone for Wall Street as political race heats up .

For Wall Street , this is the season to be cautious as the presidential contest puts the stock market in the twilight zone . 
056000000000000000000000

President Clinton , Bob Dole and Ross Perot are hitting the road now that the partying is over , and people who have billions of dollars invested in stocks were bracing for political promises that could have an impact on their wealth . 
0303403400000000000000000000000000000000000

Analysts believe that the candidates will add to the market 's list of uncertainties , which already includes the question of whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to cool economic growth . 
0000000000000000000000012000000000

They say the politicians will need to promote legislation that helps the economy without scaring the socks off financial markets . 
000000000000000000000

" The worst thing that could happen for financial markets is that if Clinton and Dole start to trade shots in the middle of the ring with one-upmanship , " said Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. " That 's when Wall Street will need to worry . " 
00000000000003030000000000000003400000122000056000000

He said that the bond market would be the first to react if the " bidding " intensifies and stocks would quickly drop as interest rates rise . 
0000000000000000000000000000

" I do n't think it would imply the collapse of the stock market , unless the rise in rates touches off a dynamic within the market , which would include selling by portfolio managers , redemptions by individuals of mutual funds that would , in turn , pressure the portfolio managers to sell even more stock . " 
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

This week , the market weighed Dole 's proposal to lower federal income taxes by 15 percent across the board , a package that carries a price tag of $ 548 billion . 
000000300000000000000000000000000

Clinton proposes an $ 8.4 billion re-election agenda that would spare most home-sellers from capital gains taxes and give employers tax incentives to hire people off the welfare rolls . 
300000000000000000000000000000

Clinton claims Dole 's plan would increase the deficit , while the White House said some corporate taxes would be raised to offset the cost of the president 's plan . 
3030000000005600000000000000000

The experts said there are some unusual risks for the market from this year 's political season because the rush to promise tax cuts to win votes could upset Wall Street 's expectations that Washington will balance the budget . 
0000000000000000000000000000056000500000

" The stock market will have to edit the promises and then do a probability study on those edited promises , " said John Geraghty at the consulting firm North American Equity Services . 
0000000000000000000000034000012220

During the past four presidential elections , the candidate that has favoured tax cuts has won . 
00000000000000000

Ronald Reagan 's tax cut won him a second four-year term in the White House in 1984 , while Democrat Walter Mondale , who promised higher taxes , lost . 
340000000000056000073400000000

George Bush became president in 1988 on his no-new-tax campaign and Clinton won in 1992 with a promise to fatten workers ' paychecks . 
340000000003000000000000

The trick , they said , will be for the candidates to continue to convince Wall Street that the Treasury 's 30-year bond -- the most closely-watched interest rate -- will fall to between 4 percent and 5 percent by the end of the decade . 
0000000000000005600100000000000000000000000000

Johnson said that long-term interest rates have already been spooked by the election . 
30000000000000

The long-term bond jumped this week to 7.13 percent after starting the year at 5.95 percent . 
00000000000000000

The surge of buying in stocks during the last two years has come amid an environment of low interest rates , which has boosted corporate profits . 
000000000000000000000000000

But the market stalled this summer after the Dow Jones industrial average set a record high of 5,778.00 points on May 22 . 
00000000780000000000000

" The market does n't seem to be able to make new highs and it has been back and forth in a fairly horizontal mode which looks like a holding pattern , " said Geraghty . 
000000000000000000000000000000000030

He said the market reflects the political uncertainty , now that Dole has sharply narrowed the gap with Clinton in the polls . 
00000000000300000030000

Geraghty said that the one thing that could completely turn the election around are new findings in the Whitewater scandal that would damage the Clintons . 
30000000000000000050000030

" Stocks are on a delicate edge because if something happens that looks like it could upset the presidency , it could throw the political and , to some extent the economic , process into chaos , " Geraghty said . 
00000000000000000000000000000000000000300

Right now , Wall Street is pondering the candidates . 
0005600000

" We have an election where there are so many unknown variables that most people will probably want to hold fire , and even take the chance that they will have to pay higher prices for stocks after the November election , than take the risk that a shock to the system will hurt the stock market , " Geraghty said . 
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000300

On Friday , the Dow Jones index closed down 31.44 points at 5,616.21 .

Factory orders rose in July and manufacturing surged in the Midwest in August , reports said Friday , sparking worries about inflation that battered financial markets for a second straight day . 
00000000005000000000000000000000

The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods climbed 1.8 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion -- nearly twice the increase that had been expected . 
012000000000000000000000000000

Shipments of everything from new cars to food items rose , as did order backlogs , in a sign that the strength in the industrial sector would continue in coming months . 
00000000000000000000000000000000

A separate report from Chicago area purchasing managers underlined the strength in manufacturing as the group 's barometer of manufacturing in the region jumped to 60 in August from 51.2 in July . 
000050000000000000000000000000000

A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing . 
000000000

While production and orders rose at Midwest area businesses , the prices they paid for goods used in manufacturing remained well in check . 
000000500000000000000000

Analysts said the reports implied the economy was not slowing down in the third quarter after a burst of growth in the spring , and that the lull in late June and July was more temporary than Federal Reserve policy-makers had wanted . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000000120000

" It appears that August is showing an economy again reversing course and is not moving onto a significantly slower track at this point , " said economist Lynn Reaser of Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville , Fla . 
000000000000000000000000000034012205050

The reports fanned worries on Wall Street that the Fed , the nation 's central bank , would raise rates next month in a bid to ward off inflation , driving stock and bond prices sharply lower for a second day running . 
0000056001000000000000000000000000000000000

The 30-year Treasury fell almost a point , raising its yield , which moves in the opposite direction from the price , to 7.12 percent from 7.04 percent late Thursday . 
0010000000000000000000000000000

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.44 points to 5,616.21 after a 64.73-point decline Thursday . 
0780000000000000

A third report from the Commerce Department , on July personal income and spending , pointed to a potential slowdown in consumer spending that some analysts said may help moderate growth in the second half . 
000001200000000000000000000000000000

It showed spending rose only 0.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June . 
0000000000000000000000000000

Incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June . 
000000000000000000000000000

July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest in six months , since January when they were flat . 
00000000000000000000

Economist Joel Naroff of First Union bank in Philadelphia said consumer spending , which fuels two-thirds of the nation 's economy , may be much slower in the third quarter than in the first half , which should slow economic growth . 
034012005000000000000000000000000000000000

" The FOMC ( Federal Open Market Committee ) has been forecasting a slowing in economic activity and moderating household demand will have a large impact on overall economic growth , " Naroff said in a written comment . 
001012220000000000000000000000003000000

The policy-making FOMC is to meet on Sept . 
001000000

24 to plot interest-rate strategy . 
000000

It already has adopted a bias toward raising rates to keep a lid on wage and price rises and help sustain the 5-1 / 2-year-old economic expansion . 
0000000000000000000000000000

In an interview on the cable television network CNBC Friday , Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence Lindsey said there still were " mixed signals " about the economy 's direction . 
000000001001203400000000000000

" I think that , on balance , it is looking a little bit on the strong side , " Lindsey said . 
00000000000000000000300

He added that with expansion as solid as it is and with unemployment so low " the greater risks are clearly that we might see some overheating . " 
00000000000000000000000000000

While July consumer spending rose only slightly , there were ample indications that consumers remained confident . 
00000000000000000

The University of Michigan 's August index of consumer sentiment , made available on Friday to paying subscribers , rose to 95.3 from 94.7 in July . 
012200000000000000000000000

Reaser said strong consumer confidence coupled with relatively lean inventories were providing manufacturers with a reason to gear up production . 
300000000000000000000

" The economy is not going to be expanding at the 4.8 percent ( annual ) rate that we had in the second quarter but it is likely to keep expanding in the 3 percent range , " she said , above the 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent that the Fed considers to be non-inflationary . 
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000

New orders to factories were strong for durable goods like new cars and for nondurables like paper and food products . 
000000000000000000000

Orders for durable goods , meant to last three years or more , rose a revised 1.7 percent in July after falling 0.2 percent in June . 
000000000000000000000000000

Orders for nondurables jumped 1.8 percent following a 1.2 percent decrease in June .

Mexican avocados not expected in U.S . 
7000050

WASHINGTON 1996-08-30

U.S. Agriculture Department officials said Friday that Mexican avocados -- which are restricted from entering the continental United States -- will not likely be entering U.S. markets any time soon , even if the controversial ban were lifted today . 
1220000700000000056000000500000000000000

" The opportunity to import ( Mexican avocados ) probably wo n't become possible for another year , " said Paul Drazek , senior trade advisor to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman . 
00000070000000000000340000000340

" We could lift the ban tomorrow , but that would not mean anything immediately , " said Drazek . " 
000000000000000000300

We probably would not see avacados come in until next season , next November . " 
0000000000000000

The Agriculture Department proposed more than a year ago to significantly ease an 82-year ban on Mexican avocados . 
0120000000000000700

Under the administration 's proposal , the borders to the Mexican produce would be opened into 19 Northern and Northeastern states from November through February . 
00000000007000000000000000

The plan has raised a storm of protest from U.S. avocado growers , who are largely concentrated in California . 
00000000050000000050

California growers have charged that removing the restrictions , even on a limited basis , would endanger the $ 1 billion U.S. industry if potentially harmful Mexican insects were brought into the country along with the avocados . 
50000000000000000000050000700000000000

Mexican officials contend that there is no scientific basis for the ban , and that it is illegal under international trading rules of the World Trade Organisation . 
7000000000000000000000001220

Proponents of the plan discount the worries of the U.S. growers and say the plan has enough safeguards built into it to eliminate any significant threat to American producers . 
000000000500000000000000000700

Under the proposal , only imports of export-quality avocados growing in approved orchards in Michoacan , Mexico , the country 's main avocado area , would be allowed . 
00000000000000505000000000000

Mexican growers and distributors would have to abide by strict rules established by the Mexican and U.S. agriculture agencies . 
70000000000000705000

The California Avocado Commission -- which has spearheaded the opposition to lifting the ban -- said new data the group submitted to the Agriculture Department last spring shows the department underestimated the pest problem in Mexico and have urged that the agency reopen its study of the issue . 
0122000000000000000000012000000000050000000000000

The administration is still studying the new data , and officials have said that if experts think the information is significant , the agency could reopen its investigation . 
00000000000000000000000000000

But U.S. avocado industry sources said that while they may have delayed the plan for a while , they ultimately do not expect the administration to change its position . 
050000000000000000000000000000

" From a common-sense view , the department should reconsider this plan , but due to politics they will probably go ahead with this , " said Tom Bellamore of the California avocado group . 
00000000000000000000000000034005000

Administration officials said they want to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible , but said there is no timetable they are working under . 
00000000000000000000000000

" It 's a very complicated issue , " said the Agriculture Department 's Drazek . " 
00000000000120300

We 'll get it resolved as quickly as we can , based on the best available science . "

U.S. Cardinal Bernardin says has terminal cancer . 
50300000

CHICAGO 1996-08-30 
50

Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin , head of the second-largest U.S. Roman Catholic archdiocese , said on Friday his doctors had diagnosed him as having liver cancer and he had a year or less to live . 
503400000578000000000000000000000000

Bernardin , 68 , underwent extensive surgery for pancreatic cancer in June 1995 followed by months of chemotherapy , which he said made him more aware of his own vulnerabilities and the need to minister to the sick . 
300000000000000000000000000000000000000

" On Wednesday , examinations indicated that the cancer has returned , this time in the liver . 
000000000000000000

I am told that it is terminal and that my life expectancy is one year or less , " a composed Bernardin told a news conference . 
000000000000000000000300000

In 14 years as Chicago 's archbishop , he built a prayerful , saintly image and was deeply involved in world church issues and publicly committed to rooting out abuses by clergy . 
000050000000000000000000000000000

" I have been assured that I still have some quality time left , " he said , saying he would undergo a new form of chemotherapy but his doctors have told him there was only a slim chance of a cure and the liver cancer was inoperable . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

" It 's not going to be easy to say goodbye to everybody . 
00000000000000

Death does have some sad dimensions to it but I am a man of faith , " he said . " 
000000000000000000000

Death is a natural phenomenom . " 
0000000

He said he would " serve until the end " as cardinal . 
0000000000000

Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly forms of the disease , although Bernardin 's case was caught early . 
00000000000003000000

Surgeons removed a cancerous kidney , parts of his pancreas and stomach , small intestine , bile duct and surrounding tissues .

Ironically , Bernardin , who developed a progressive , much-praised programme to deal with pedophilia involving priests , became the highest-ranking church official ever accused of sexual improprieties when a former seminary student leveled charges in 1993 that he had been sexually abused by Bernardin during the 1970s .

The $ 9.5 billion proposed acquisition of Boatmen 's Bancshares Inc. by NationsBank Corp. could spark a flurry of other mergers involving Missouri banks , which until last year were protected from outside buyers by state regulations . 
00000001222012000000005000000000000000

" NationsBank just strolled into the Midwest and bagged the biggest banking trophy in the landscape , " said Michael Ancell , banking industry analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co . "

Whoever wants a big market position in the Midwest has to come in and grab Mercantile or Commerce . " 
00000000500000010100

St. Louis-based Mercantile Bancorp Inc. , a bank holding company with $ 18.04 billion in assets , was seen by many analysts as the most attractive Missouri franchise in size after Boatmen 's . 
7812200000000000000000000050000120

Kansas City , Mo.-based Commerce Bancshares Inc. , with $ 9.32 billion in assets , also could help a regional bank establish a strong presence in the lower Midwest , analysts added . 
560712200000000000000000000050000

" It focuses more attention on Mercantile , Commerce and Roosevelt , " said James Weber , analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons .

Among those seen as having an interest in buying in Missouri are Minneapolis-based First Bank System Inc. and Norwest Corp. , Ohio-based KeyCorp and Banc One Corp. , and First Chicago NBD Corp. in Illinois . 
000000000050712220120710122001222050

Representatives of First Bank , Norwest , Banc One and First Chicago said the banks do not comment on rumors of possible mergers or acquisitions .

Boatmen 's was the prize in Missouri , where barriers to outside acquirers were brought down last year by a federal banking statute .

" Boatmen 's was the plum of Missouri and was the plum of the central Midwest , " Weber said . 
012000050000000500300

Talk that the Missouri banks were seeking inflated prices from buyers was seen as a reason a deal has not occurred sooner . 
00050000000000000000000

But NationsBank 's bid , representing a premium of 40 percent for Boatmen 's stock , was large enough to get the deal done . 
0100000000001200000000000

" I think Boatmen 's was shopping itself , and everybody knew if you wanted to be the winning buyer here , you had to make the bid nobody would beat , " Ancell said . 
000120000000000000000000000000000300

But some analysts cautioned that other targets should not expect as large a premium . 
000000000000000

They also questioned whether NationsBank can recoup shareholder value with such a large bid for Boatmen 's . 
000010000000000120

" I think initially some stocks will trade up on sympathy , but the wild premium NationsBank put on this deal here , I do n't see a lot of other deals being done at this premium , " said Michael Durante , analyst at McDonald & Co .

U.S. tight-lipped on Libya 's award to Farrakhan .

WASHINGTON 1996-08-30

The State Department refused to speculate on Friday on what might happen in the case of Louis Farrakhan , the U.S. black leader who was awarded a $ 250,000 human rights prize by Libya . 
01200000000000003400500000000000050

" I 'm not going to speculate about what may or may not happen in that case , " State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said . " 
000000000000000000012034000

... The view of the U.S. government on ( Farrakhan 's ) not accepting any gifts from Libya is well-known . "

Davies also noted : " We 've talked about the passport restriction for travel to Libya " but he did not elaborate . 
30000000000000050000000

The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday denied Farrakhan 's application to receive the $ 250,000 award or a $ 1 billion donation Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had pledged to Farrakhan 's Nation of Islam group after they met last January . 
01220003000000000000007034000301220000000

Farrakhan organised last October 's Million Man March that brought thousands of black men to Washington for a peaceful rally .

The Treasury Department said Libya was on the U.S. list of states that sponsor international terrorism and noted that Tripoli has refused to hand over two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland . 
012050005000000000050000007000000788805050

Equipment problems and mechanical failure forced a recovery expedition to give up efforts to retrieve a giant slab of the RMS Titanic from the ocean floor , a spokeswoman said on Friday . 
000000000000000000007800000000000

A 20-ton piece of the Titanic 's steel hull , which had been attached by cables to a recovery ship off the coast of Newfoundland , Canada , fell back to the bottom of the sea , said Erin Purcell of Boston-based Reagan Communications that represents two of the ships used in the expedition . 
0000070000000000000000005050000000000034071200000000000

The piece of hull , lifted from the ocean floor by means of several diesel-filled bags , had been stuck about 200 feet ( about 70 metres ) below the water 's surface before it fell , she said . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

It fell as recovery crews were trying to haul the piece into more shallow water and several of the bags burst and cables snapped , she said . 
0000000000000000000000000000

The steel-hulled Titanic , thought to be unsinkable , struck an iceberg on April 14 , 1912 , and sank , killing 1,523 of the 2,200 passengers and crew on board . 
00700000000000000000000000000000

The German government urged Israelis and Palestinians on Friday to avoid any course of action that might jeopardise the peace process in the Middle East .

Israel announced this week the expansion of Jewish West Bank settlements surrounding Jerusalem and the demolition of an Arab community centre in East Jerusalem .

City officials there said the centre was being erected illegally .

But Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said the moves by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's government were tantamount to war . 
07034000000340000000

Tension has been rising in the region since . 
000000000

" We believe that the Israeli settlement policy in the occupied areas is an obstacle to the establishment of peace , " German Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said . 
000007000000000000000071203400

" All concerned must avoid taking any course of action that could pose an obstacle to the peace process and which could make a peaceful solution difficult , " he said , as news came of a renewed breakdown in Arab-Israeli peace talks in Jerusalem . 
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000700050

Erdmann told reporters Bonn supported European Union efforts to persuade Israel to stop further Jewish settlement on the West Bank . 
300501200050007000560

The foreign ministry later announced Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy would visit Bonn for talks with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel next month .

50000700000000500001200000000000000

A Guinean man , detained in a round-up in the Saint-Bernard church a week ago , was deported on a scheduled Air France flight to Conakry after his appeals failed , a spokesman for Air France 's pro-Socialist CFDT union said . 
070000000050000000000120050000000012001000

He was apparently the eighth African deported from among 210 people evicted from the church after a 50-day occupation aimed at securing residence permits , unions said . 
0000070000000000000000000000

Most of the others have been released after a brief stay in detention . 
00000000000000

About 100 people from the CFDT and the Communist-led CGT unions marched outside Air France headquarters at Charles de Gaulle airport north of Paris against the use of civilian jets and staff in deporting illegal immigrants . 
0000010071000120056600050000000000000

" We must obtain a formal commitment from ( Air France chairman ) Christian Blanc that no plane , no personnel be used to transform our air companies into charters of shame , " CFDT spokesman Francois Cabrera said . 
0000000001200340000000000000000000103400

He said civilians should not be police accomplices .

Syria slams Israel on settlements . 
505000

DAMASCUS 1996-08-30 
50

Syria on Friday condemned Israel 's settlement policy and said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was preparing for war with Arabs . 
500050000000340000070

" Practices of the Israeli government , especially its settlement activities , came to confirm that dealing with this government inflicts the biggest harm on the Arab cause , " state-run Damascus Radio said in a commentary . 
00007000000000000000000000700001200000

" When this government insists on stabbing the peace process and tearing it apart , this means that it is preparing for war , " the radio said . 
00000000000000000000000000000

Palestinian President Yasser Arafat described this week the decision to expand settlements in the West Bank as a declaration of war . 
7034000000000056000000

Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza observed a strike on Thursday to protest against the Israeli move . 
7005605000000000700

The radio urged Arabs to unify their ranks to thwart the policies of the right-wing Israeli government . 
000700000000000700

" Israel could not confront a united Arab stand or usurp their rights because the Arab rights could be regained when they achieve unity and solidarity , " Damascus radio said . 
05000007000000070000000000005000

It welcomed the international criticism of Israel 's settlement policies but called for practical steps to force the Israeli government to abandon this policy . 
0000005000000000007000000

" It is important to translate the criticism into pressuring action to prevent Israel from undermining the big international efforts aimed at making the peace process achieve success , " the radio said . 
0000000000000500000000000000000000

Syria and Arabs have been dismayed by Netanyahu 's refusal to trade the occupied Arab lands for peace , his support for the expansion of settlements and his insistance on Jerusalem as a unifed capital for Israel . 
50700003000000700000000000000050000050

Syria has held sporadic peace talks with Israel since 1991 without achieving a breakthrough .

CAIRO 1996-08-30

Police have detained 26 suspected members of Egypt 's largest militant group al-Gama'a al-Islamiya ( Islamic Group ) , government newspapers reported on Friday . 
0000000500001201200000000

They said police arrested the militants in the eastern Sharqiyah province after capturing their leader Rami al-Saadani in a satellite city outside Cairo . 
000000000500000340000050

Al-Akhbar newspapers said the men had been plotting against " strategic institutions and prominent individuals " but gave no other details . 
1000000000000000000000

The newspapers said the men were being interrogated . 
000000000

State security officials were not immediately available for comment . 
0000000000

More than 960 people have been killed in the armed struggle the Gama'a launched in 1992 to topple President Hosni Mubarak 's government and establish a purist Islamic state in its place

Kamil Jamil did n't have a prayer .

An Israeli roadblock stopped the 38-year-old Palestinian from answering Yasser Arafat 's call to worship at Jerusalem 's al-Aqsa mosque on Friday . 
07000070034000005050000

" Go home . 
0000

There are no prayers today , " an Israeli soldier yelled at Jamil in Hebrew . 
0000000070003070

Palestinian President Arafat , attacking Israel 's decision to expand Jewish settlements and its policy on Jerusalem , went before the Palestinian legislature on Wednesday to urge the two million Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza to go to the holy city . 
70300500007000005000070000000070056050000000

Pilgrims stood little chance of making progress . 
00000000

Palestinians have been banned by Israel from travelling from the West Bank to Jerusalem since suicide bombings by Moslem militants killed 59 people in the Jewish state in February and March . 
70000500005605000070000007000000

And Israeli checkpoints have circled Jerusalem since 1993 , a concrete and constant reminder of Israel 's hold on a city it considers its eternal capital . 
070005000000000500000000000

The PLO wants Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state . 
010566000000700

Only a few Palestinians trickled to the roadblocks . 
000700000

They were immediately turned back . 
000000

" I am heeding Abu Ammar 's ( Arafat 's ) call to pray at al-Aqsa and I came . 
00003400300000050000

It is our duty towards al-Aqsa to come and pray , " Jamil said . 
000005000000300

A tourist from Jordan was also told by Israeli soldiers at the al-Ram checkpoint that he could not enter Jerusalem . 
000500007000500000050

" We have a peace treaty with them and we let them go wherever they want when they come to Jordan , " said the tourist , Khaled Hijazi , 37 . " 
000000000000000000005000000340000

I feel terrible . 
0000

I am entitled to see Jerusalem , " he said . 
00000500000

Some Palestinians took to back roads , only to run into waiting Israeli security forces . 
0700000000007000

" The Israelis have no right to prevent us from going to pray . 
00700000000000

What kind of peace is this that prevents us from reaching our holy places ? " 
0000000000000000

asked Mustafa Hoshiyeh , a 27-year-old West Bank labourer turned around by a police patrol on a back road . 
03400056000000000000

" Abu Ammar ( Arafat ) is right . 
034030000

We have signed a peace treaty with the Israelis but on the ground , we see that nothing has changed , " said 20-year-old Ali Ahmed from Qalandia refugee camp .

Consumer spending , incomes edge up in July . 
000000000

Glenn Somerville

WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 
50

Consumer spending barely edged up in July , the Commerce Department said Friday , as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months . 
000000000120000000000000000

Spending rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June . 
00000000000000000000000

Incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June . 
000000000000000000000000000

Department officials said July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest for any month since January , when they were flat . 
00000000000000000000000

Wages and salaries came under pressure in July as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks . 
000000000000000000000

The department said wages and salaries decreased by $ 6.9 billion in July after climbing $ 45 billion in June . 
000000000000000000000

" In July , average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined , more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment , " Commerce said . 
0000000000000000000000000100

But more money went into savings accounts , as savings held at 5.3 cents out of each dollar earned in both June and July . 
0000000000000000000000000

That was the highest savings rate since October last year , when 5.5 cents out of each dollar earned was being saved . 
00000000000000000000000

The generally lackluster report on spending and incomes in July had been expected . 
00000000000000

At the same time , the department said in a separate report that new orders received by U.S. factories climbed strongly in July , with widespread gains across most major categories . 
00000000000000000500000000000000

Orders increased 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion , significantly stronger than the 1 percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists . 
0000000000000000000005600

That followed a revised 0.7 percent decline in June orders . 
00000000000

Commerce said previously that spending at retail stores was up only 0.1 percent in July , partly because of softer sales of new cars and light trucks . 
0000000000000000000000000000

In addition , the Labour Department 's July employment report had foreshadowed the muted income growth . 
00001200000000000

It showed average hourly earnings fell in July by 0.2 percent to $ 11.00 and the average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.7 in June . 
000000000000000000000000000

Gains in personal income , which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends , interest and businesses , are essential for funding consumer purchases , which fuel two-thirds of national economic activity . 
000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Spending on all types of durable goods , which includes cars , fell to an annual rate of $ 626.3 billion in July from $ 633.6 billion in June . 
000000000000000000000000000000

But spending on nondurable products increased moderately to a rate of $ 1.55 trillion from $ 1.54 trillion in June , while spending for services was up to $ 2.97 trillion in July from $ 2.96 trillion . 
00000000000000000000000000000000000000

Payrolls of manufacturing companies rose in July by $ 2.3 billion to an annual rate of $ 678 billion .

The dollar rose slightly against the German mark , but edged lower against the Japanese yen .

07800000000000000000000000000

In the broader market , declining issues beat advances 1,627 to 743 on moderate volume of 321 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange . 
00000000000000000000012220

In the bond market , the 30-year Treasury bond fell 23/32 of a point , or $ 7.1875 on a $ 1,000 bond , raising its yield to 7.04 percent -- the highest since July 31 -- from 6.98 percent at Wednesday 's close .

012000000000000000000000000000000000

In another report , sales of new homes jumped unexpectedly in July to the briskest rate in five months , driving prices up in a strong housing market . 
00000000000000000000000000000

Sales shot up 7.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 783,000 units -- the strongest since February , when new homes were selling at a rate of 784,000 a year . 
00000000000000000000000000000000000

Analysts said the stock market was also worried about the impact on President Clinton 's re-election bid of his top political strategist resigning . 
000000000000030000000000

Dick Morris , who is credited with resurrecting Clinton 's political fortunes over the past 18 months by masterminding his turn to the political centre , quit after a supermarket tabloid reported he engaged in a yearlong affair with a prostitute , with whom he allegedly shared confidential campaign documents .

Pirelli cables look to tap Chinese growth .

Italian tyre and cables giant Pirelli on Friday announced its long-awaited move into China with a cables joint venture set to capitalise on the rapidly-growing Chinese telecommunications market . 
70000100000005000000000007000

Pirelli is linking with Hong Kong-based group CITIC Pacific in a venture to be called the Wuxi Tong Ling Company Ltd , which will operate in partnership with a local industrial company at its existing factory in Wuxi , Jiangsu province , Shanghai . 
10007801200000001222200000000000000005050050

The partners will invest around $ 30 million in the existing copper cable plant at Wuxi to update technology and include optic fibre production , with annual turnover expected to reach $ 60 million within the next few years . 
0000000000000005000000000000000000000000

The move marks a further move by Pirelli 's cables division to expand in the fast-growing Far Eastern developing markets with the group already present in Indonesia , India and Malaysia . 
00000001000000007800000000505050

" This is really positive news for Pirelli , and I expect that it will produce one of the best half-year results in late September compared to other industrial Italian companies , " said analyst Paula Buratti at Indosuez . 
0000000100000000000000000000070000034010

She emphasised that the move was positive because Pirelli will have management control of the Chinese venture , and it also showed another example of Pirelli exporting its technical know-how to developing markets . 
0000000010000007000000000100000000

Pirelli shares reacted favourable even though talks had been underway for some time and news about a venture had been widely expected . 
10000000000000000000000

The shares rose 0.2 percent to 2,555 lire by 1350 GMT in an easier Milan stock market . 
000000000070005000

This will be Pirelli 's first industrial involvement in a Chinese market where demand for telecommunication networks is expected to grow to 80-100 million new lines between 1996 and 2000 , doubling demand for optical cables . 
0001000000700000000000000000000000000

China 's second largest telecoms operator Unicom already has a mandate from the central government to establish 15 million new phone lines by the year 2000 , which will necessitate new trunk line systems and local distribution networks . 
500000100000000000000000000000000000000

" The starting of this production base in China has for our group an undoubted strategic value , representing an important enhancement of our presence in Asia , " said Pirelli SpA chairman and chief executive officer Marco Tonchetti Provera . 
00000000500000000000000000500012000003440

Pirelli Cables has global sales of over $ 3.5 billion , and has become a large supplier of optic cables and systems to major telecoms carriers in the U.S. , Europe and the Far East . 
120000000000000000000000000050500560

CITIC Pacific is a major Hong Kong-listed company focusing on infrastruture , trading , distribution and property , with 28 percent of its 1995 profits coming from telecoms .

Dutch bond futures revival delayed - EOE .

AMSTERDAM 1996-08-30

A broad attempt to spur activity in Dutch bond futures has been delayed to give participants a chance to become familiar with the trading system , the European Options Exchange ( EOE ) said on Friday . 
0000000700000000000000000001220100000

Market-making in the rarely-traded FTO contract was expected to begin today , but an EOE spokesman said the 10 banks and brokers involved in the initiative needed time to get accustomed to changes in the electronic trading system . 
000010000000001000000000000000000000000

" It 's not ready yet . 
0000000

We found it wise to take some time between the commitment to start and the actual start , " EOE spokesman Lex van Drooge told Reuters . 
000000000000000000010344010

He said no date had been fixed yet for the start of price making in the 10-year contract , but the EOE had agreed to speak again to the participants in one to two weeks . 
000000000000000000000100000000000000

Investors in Dutch bonds currently use German bond futures to hedge their portfolios because the FTO contract is so illiquid .

A limited attempt to reinvigorate the contract two years ago failed .

OSCE defends record over Chechnya peace mission . 
10005000

BONN 1996-08-30

The head of an international mediating mission defended its record on Friday in the face of criticism by pro-Moscow leaders in breakway Chechnya and insisted it was doing its best to bring peace to the region . 
0000000000000000000000500000000000000

Flavio Cotti , the chairman of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , told German radio the Vienna-based body viewed the conflict in Chechnya as an internal Russian problem . 
34000001222222010007007000005000700

" The OSCE is completely involved . 
0010000

But one must not forget that the OSCE only has limited powers there , " said Cotti , who is also the Swiss foreign minister . " 
000000010000000000000070000

Our mission in Chechnya has done all it can within the given limitations . " 
000500000000000

Pro-Moscow leaders in Chechnya have criticised Tim Guldimann , the Swiss diplomat who heads the OSCE Chechnya mission , saying he was biased toward Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev , president of the self-declared separatist government . 
7005003400700001500000003400000000

Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed and Chechen separatist military leader Aslan Maskhadov started a new round of peace talks on Friday just outside the rebel region . 
70340700034000000000000000

Cotti said Chechnya must remain part of Russia , but the solution to the conflict would be to accord the region maximum autonomy within Russia 's borders . 
3050000500000000000000005000

" There is no doubt that Chechnya , according to OSCE principles , belongs to a state called Russia , " he said , pointing out that Russia was an OSCE member and it was not the organisation 's policy to challenge members ' sovereignty . 
0000005000100000005000000005001000000000000000

He added that the OSCE was the only international body which has been allowed into the Chechnya to monitor the human rights situation there , but that its means were restricted by the fact that the conflict was a " internal issue " . 
00001000000000005000000000000000000000000000

" We have a small concept , the details of which have yet to be worked out . 
000000000000000000

Chechnya must be accorded the maximum autonomy possible within the framework of Russian integrity , " said Cotti .

The Dutch transport minister Annemarie Jorritsma told the country ' second chamber that there is no further need to investigate the 1992 crash of an El Al freighter which left 43 dead in an Amsterdam suburb . 
0700340000000000000000000120000000500

She said that a request from her ministry for the aircraft 's waybill documentation and further information about the contents of its hold had been complied with by El Al 's head office in Tel Aviv . 
0000000000000000000000000000120000560

The Dutch transport ministry had come in for pressure from a cross-section of Dutch members of parliaments in May this year , some of whom believed the aircraft had been carrying unlisted , dangerous goods . 
070000000000070000000000000000000000

Others said they thought the aircraft was loaded with too much airfreight . 
0000000000000

Jorritsma said the latest evidence from El Al in no way supported the allegations , and added there is no justification for a further investigation into the incident .

Representatives from Armenia and Azerbaijan held talks earlier this week in Germany on bringing a lasting peace to the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region , a diplomatic source close to the talks said on Friday . 
0050500000050000000050000000000000

The source , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said Azerbaijani presidential adviser Vafa Gulizade and his Armenian counterpart Zhirayr Liparityan met to discuss the disputed enclave on Wednesday and had now flown home . 
000000000003003400703400000000000000

An uneasy ceasefire has prevailed in Nagorno-Karabakh , which represents around 20 percent of Azeri territory , since May 1994 after ethnic Armenians drove Azeris out of the region . 
000000500000007000000070700000

The conflict , which began in 1988 , claimed over 10,000 lives . 
0000000000000

" The main subject ( of the talks ) was the search for a peaceful solution for Nagorno-Karabakh , " the source said . 
000000000000000005000000

He declined to reveal any more details about the content of the talks or their exact location in Germany . 
00000000000000000050

Azerbaijan has said it is prepared to grant autonomy to Nagorno-Karabakh if Armenian forces pull out , but will not accept Armenia 's demands for the independence of the enclave . 
5000000000500000000005000000000

Russia 's Interfax news agency reported on Tuesday the officials had departed for negotiations in Germany , adding that face-to-face talks between the two sides first took place last December in Amsterdam . 
501000000000000500000000000000050

Interfax said the discussions were being held in parallel with peace talks mediated by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) and the broad-based Minsk Group of countries led by Russia and Finland .

Sombre mood on Arctic island after plane crash .

LONGYEAR , Norway 1996-08-30

The windblown , chilly streets of this tiny Arctic town are all but deserted and flags are flying at half-mast beneath a brooding , clouded sky . 
000000007000000000000000000

Longyear is a town in mourning , a close-knit community that has been shattered . 
500000000000000

Disaster struck on Thursday when a Russian airliner bringing coal miners to work crashed as it came in to land at the airport , killing all 141 people on board . 
0000007000000000000000000000000

" It 's a sight I will never forget . 
0000000000

I will remember it for the rest of my life , " said Stig Onarheim . 
0000000000000340

He was one of a handful of rescuers who raced to the scene of the crash in a helicopter on Thursday , hoping in vain to find survivors . 
00000000000000000000000000000

The plane smashed into a snow-capped mountain on the Arctic island of Spitzbergen on Thursday , just east of Longyear . 
000000000700500000050

" Imagine a big plane with a lot of luggage and people on board . 
000000000000000

Think of all that mixed together , with twisted , wrecked parts on the slope , " Onarheim , 29 , told Reuters . 
000000000000000005000010

Police and local officials have sealed off the crash site , protecting it from intrusive reporters and from the polar bears that roam freely across the icy expanses . 
00000000000000000000000000000

The dead were all Russians and Ukrainians , coming to work in the mining towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden . 
00007070000000005050

Longyear is a Norwegian settlement of just over 1,000 people , but it also feels the loss keenly . 
5007000000000000000

" I have trouble finding the words to express my grief . 
000000000000

It 's a tragedy for everyone . 
0000000

We know many of the people who live in Barentsburg , some of them could have been on the plane , " said Johan Sletten , 52 . 
0000000005000000000000034000

Sletten , a caretaker who has lived on the island for 30 years , said the Norwegian and Russian communities visit frequently , competing at soccer in the summer and with snow-scooter races in the winter . 
3000000000000000707000000000000000000

Teenage shop assistant Heidi Groenstein was blunter . 
00034000

" I 'm glad it was not a Norwegian plane , " she said . " 
0000000070000000

Just think of it -- a mining village where so many workers die . 
00000000000000

They must be having a tough time of it now . " 
000000000000

Barentsburg , just a few hours ride by snow-scooter or 15 minutes by helicopter from Longyear , has asked to be left alone with its grief and told reporters to stay away . 
500000000000000500000000000000000

Around 100 Russian and Ukrainian miners were waiting in Longyear to fly home on the plane that crashed . 
0070700005000000000

They were given shelter in the town 's church overnight and ate a sombre breakfast before getting on a bus for the airport . 
000000000000000000000000

Another plane had been sent from Moscow to pick them up . 
000000500000

At this time of year , the only colour in Longyear comes from the brightly-painted wooden houses . 
000000000050000000

Everything else is muddy , the waters of the fjord leaden . 
000000000000

Winter is in the air . 
000000

Barentsburg is an even grimmer place , a run-down testament to the hardships of the new Russia . 
500000000000000050

Spitzbergen lies some 500 miles ( 800 km ) off the northern tip of Norway and endures one of the most extreme climates on the planet . 
500000000000005000000000000

Inhabited by fewer than 3,000 people in total , it sees the sun for 24 hours a day during summer and is plunged into round-the-clock darkness in the winter months . 
0000000000000000000000000000000

The terrain is mountainous , the only roads are dirt tracks . 
000000000000

Norway rules the island group under the terms of a 1920s international treaty which gave many other nations the right to establish setttlements and exploit the coal that is still mined there .

" We have the largest and most efficient port on the South China coast ; we have the best transport and telecommunications infrastructure in the world ; and we are investing in this hardware on an enormous scale , " Tsang said in a speech to Auckland during a visit to New Zealand .

Hong Kong also had the necessary " constitutional infrastructure " in place , with the promise of autonomy in running its affairs after the handover from Britain to China . 
560000000000000000000000005050

" What this means in practice is that Hong Kong will go on raising its own taxes , issuing its own currency , setting its own expenditure priorities and managing its own enormous financial reserves , " Tsang said . 
0000000056000000000000000000000000000300

He acknowledged that many Hong Kong people had decided to seek their future elsewhere and others were sure to follow in the next nine months . "

Security Council members expressed concern on Thursday that Israel 's bulldozing of a Palestinian day-care centre for the disabled might further injure the Middle East peace process . 
1200000050000700000000056000

Responding to a letter from the the Palestinian U.N. observer mission , Security Council President Tono Eitel of Germany said that members asked him to convey their views to Israel 's charge d'affaires , David Peleg . 
0000000710001203405000000000050000340

" The members expressed their concern about the maintenance of the peace process and they urged that no action be taken that would have a negative impact on the negotiations , " Eitel said after an informal council session .

" They asked me to call in the Israeli charge d'affaires and discuss the matter with him , " he added . 
0000000070000000000000

The Palestinian letter from Marwan Jilani said the destruction of the Jerusalem centre was an effort by Israel to " alter the character , demographic composition and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem " and violated agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation .

00100000000

LA CORUNA , Spain 1996-08-31

A late goal by newly-signed defender Roberto Carlos saved the blushes of Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello and his multi-billion peseta line-up in the opening game of the Spanish championship on Saturday . 
000000340000120340000000000070000

The Brazilian 's 79th-minute effort was enough to earn Real a point from a scrappy 1-1 draw at fellow title contenders Deportivo Coruna . 
070000000100000000000120

Deportivo started strongly , taking the lead midway through the first half when former Auxerre playmaker Corentine Martins headed home a corner after a flick-on by Brazilian-born Spanish international midfielder Donato .

Real looked to be in deep trouble shortly after the break when Luis Milla was sent off for committing two bookable offences in as many minutes . 
100000000000340000000000000

But Deportivo were unable to capitalise on their numerical advantage , and were themselves reduced to ten men when Armando Alvarez was sent off 15 minutes from time .

Shortly afterwards Roberto Carlos found space in the home defence and equalised for Real with a shot that was deflected past despairing Deportivo ' keeper Jacques Songo'o . 
0034000000000100000000100340

In a frantic final five minutes there were chances at both ends , and Donato , who had earlier been booked , was sent off for protesting about the incursion of Real players at a free kick . 
00000000000000300000000000000001000000

Before the match Deportivo chairman Augusto Lendoiro said he would ignore a FIFA decision banning Brazilian midfielder Mauro Silva from playing in the match for failing to join his national side 's tour of Europe . 
000103400000100703400000000000000050

In the event , coach John Toshack decided not to use Silva , who had claimed he did not join the Brazil squad because he had lost his passport .

The Republic of Ireland 's new-look side dispelled painful memories of their last visit to Liechtenstein by beating the Alpine part-timers 5-0 in a World Cup qualifier on Saturday . 
056600000000000500070000780000

The Irish , under new manager Mick McCarthy , took a 4-0 lead within 20 minutes through captain Andy Townsend , 20-year-old Norwich striker Keith O'Neill , Sunderland forward Niall Quinn and teenager Ian Harte .

Essex and Kent both face tense finishes on Monday as they attempt to keep pace with title hopefuls Derbyshire and Surrey , convincing three-day victors on Saturday , in the English county championship run-in . 
10100000000000000010100000000070000

Essex need another 148 with five wickets in hand to beat Yorkshire after a maiden first-class century from Richard Kettleborough transformed a match which his side had seemed certain to lose . 
10000000000100000034000000000000

Kent will also need to keep their nerve against struggling Nottinghamshire who will enter the final day 137 ahead with four wickets left in a relatively low-scoring match at Tunbridge Wells . 
10000000001000000000000000000560

Derbyshire , nine-wicket winners over Worcestershire , and Surrey , who thrashed Warwickshire by an innings and 164 runs , can instead take the day off along with rivals Leicestershire , who beat Somerset inside two days . 
10000100100010000000000000000100010000

Warwickshire captain Tim Munton is tipping Surrey to emerge on top , impressed by the positive influence of Australian coach Dave Gilbert , but Derbyshire 's Australian captain Dean Jones is conceding nothing as his side chase their first title for 60 years . 
10340010000000000070340010703400000000000000

" We took three absolutely brilliant catches in this match and our catching all season has been pretty impressive .

12030001010

LONDON 1996-08-31

Former Wallaby captain Michael Lynagh began his career in English club rugby in impeccable fashion on Saturday to frustrate his old coach Bob Dwyer on his league coaching debut with Leicester . 
01034000070000000000003400000050

Lynagh kicked five penalties and a conversion from his six attempts at goal to steer his multi-national Saracens side to a 25-23 home win and offer millionaire backer Nigel Wray an early return on his big investment in the north London club . 
3000000000000000010000000000340000000000500

French centre Philippe Sella also enjoyed a good game alongside Lynagh , although the home team scored only one try through England scrum-half Kyran Bracken . 
70340000003000000000050340

The new French connection at Harlequins also made a good start , Laurent Cabannes and Laurent Benezech scoring a try apiece in their side 's 75-19 victory over Gloucester . 
007005000000340340000000000010

Former England captain Will Carling , handed the kicking duties , finished with 20 points .

With the first day of the league season briefly shifting the spotlight away from the discord between the clubs and the Rugby Football Union , there were also emphatic victories for champions Bath , 56-13 winners over Orrell , and Northampton and narrow successes for Wasps and Bristol .

South Africa managed to avoid a fifth successive defeat in 1996 at the hands of the All Blacks with an emphatic 32-22 victory in front of an ecstatic Ellis Park crowd on Saturday . 
5600000000000000120000000000560000

They scored three tries in recording their highest total against New Zealand , salvaging some pride in a season in which the world champions have lost five out of eight tests . 
00000000005600000000000000000000

It also ended a run of nine successive victories this year for New Zealand but arrived too late to prevent a 2-1 series defeat and an historic first All Black series triumph on South African soil . 
0000000000005600000000000000120007800

Springbok scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen was his side 's inspiration , scoring their opening try and making the third for flanker Andre Venter from a quickly taken penalty to give his side a 29-8 lead after 54 minutes . 
1034440000000000000000340000000000000000

Fullback Andre Joubert scored the other , scorching in from 40 metres at the start of the second half to add to his three long-range penalties . 
034000000000000000000000000

The All Blacks salvaged some pride by scoring two tries from centre Walter Little and scrum-half Justin Marshall in the final five minutes to close a gap which at one point stood at 24 points . 
012000000000340034000000000000000000

But they generally endured an off-day , highlighted by recalled fly-half Andrew Mehrtens who missed five out of eight kicks at goal . 
00000000000340000000000

Recalled fly-half Henry Honiball kicked the Springboks into a 6-0 lead after 10 minutes only to see Andrew Mehrtens launch a penalty from eight metres inside his own half to narrow the gap . 
0034001000000000034000000000000000

Mehrtens missed three further penalties and a conversion in the first 40 minutes which could have put his side ahead , but it was the Springboks who looked the more dangerous . 
30000000000000000000000001000000

Their promise was realised when Joubert made a 40-metre break in the 25th minute and , although winger Pieter Hendriks appeared to knock on Joubert 's reverse pass , Welsh referee Derek Bevan allowed Van der Westhuizen to pick up and score under the posts . 
0000030000000000003400003000070340344000000000

Honiball converted and Joubert kicked a penalty before All Black hooker Sean Fitzpatrick scored a try from close range on the stroke of half-time to narrow the lead to 16-8 and hint at a comeback . 
300300001203400000000000000000000000

Instead Joubert kicked another long penalty and then raced around the outside of the defence to score the Springboks ' second try . 
03000000000000000010000

A quick penalty from Van der Westhuizen five metres from the All Black line set up the third try for Venter five minutes later and when Joubert kicked his third penalty the Springboks held an unassailable 32-8 lead going into the last quarter .

When the All Blacks did break through , it was too late .

Centre Walter Little followed up Mehrtens ' kick to score under the posts and scrum-half Justin Marshall forced himself over from a ruck close to the line in injury-time to give them some consolation .
